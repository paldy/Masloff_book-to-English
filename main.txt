Series: NIICHAVO - 1But what is strange, what is most incomprehensible, is how authors can take such plots,
I confess, this is completely incomprehensible, that's for sure ... no, no, I don’t understand at all.

THE FUSION AROUND THE SOFAChapter first
Teacher: Children, write down the sentence: "The fish was sitting on a tree."
Student: Do fish sit on trees?
Teacher: Well... It was a crazy fish.
School jokeI was approaching my destination. Around me, clinging to the very road, green
forest, occasionally giving way to clearings overgrown with yellow sedge. The sun has been setting for an hour now
still could not sit down and hung low over the horizon. The car rolled along a narrow road covered with crisp gravel. I let large stones under the wheel, and every time they clanged in the trunk
and empty canisters rumbled.
On the right, two people came out of the forest, stepped onto the side of the road and stopped, looking in my direction. One of
them raised their hand. I let off the gas as I looked at them. They were, it seemed to me, hunters, young
people maybe a little older than me. I liked their faces and I stopped. The one who raised his hand stuck his swarthy hook-nosed face into the car and asked, smiling:
- You will not give us a lift to Solovets?
The second, with a red beard and no mustache, was also smiling, peering over his shoulder. Positive-
but they were nice people.
"Let's sit down," I said. - One forward, the other back, otherwise I have junk there, in the back
seat.
- Benefactor! - the hawk-nosed one said delightedly, took off his gun from his shoulder and sat down next to me.
The bearded man, looking hesitantly through the back door, said:
“Can I have a little of that here?”
I leaned over the back and helped him clear the space occupied by the sleeping bag and the rolled-up tent. He sat down delicately, placing the gun between his knees.
“Close the door better,” I said.
Everything went on as usual. The car started off. The hawk-nosed man turned back and spoke animatedly about the fact that it is much more pleasant to ride in a passenger car than to walk. The bearded man indistinctly agreed and kept slamming and slamming the door. “Pick up your raincoat,” I advised, looking at him in the mirror.
rear view. “Your coat is pinched.” Five minutes later, everything finally settled down. I asked: "Before
Solovets ten kilometers? “Yes,” answered the hawk-nosed one. - Or a little more. The road is true

I won't go." “You can drive along this road even in autumn.” - “Here - perhaps, but from Korobets

bearded in the back seat. "Who is speaking?" asked the hawk-nosed one. Merlin speaks. They
for some reason they laughed. I pulled out cigarettes, lit a cigarette and offered them a treat. "Clara's Factory"
Zetkin,” said the hawk-nosed one, looking at the pack. Are you from Leningrad? - "Yes". - "Are you traveling?"
“I'm traveling,” I said. “Are you from here?” “Indigenous,” said the hawk-nosed one. "I'm from Murmansk," the bearded man said. “For Leningrad, probably, Solovets and Murmansk are one and the same:
North,” said the hawk-nosed one. "No, why not," I said politely. “Are you going to stop in Solovets?” asked the hawk-nosed one. “Of course,” I said. “I am going to Solovets.” “Do you have relatives there or
familiar?" “No,” I said. I'll just wait guys. They go along the coast, and Solovets is our dot
rendezvous."
Ahead, I saw a large scattering of stones, slowed down and said: "Hold on tight." The car shook and jumped. Hook-nosed bruised his nose on the barrel of a gun. The motor roared, the stones beat in
bottom. "Poor car," said the hawk-nosed one. “What to do…” I said. “Not everyone would go
such a road in your car. “I would go,” I said. The spill is over. "Oh, it's not yours.
car," the hook-nosed man guessed. “Well, how do I get a car! It's a rental." “Understood,” he said.
hook-nosed, as it seemed to me, disappointed. I felt hurt. “What’s the point of buying a car to drive on asphalt? Where there is asphalt, there is nothing interesting, and where it is interesting, there is no asphalt.” “Yes, of course,” the hook-nosed man agreed politely. "It's stupid, in my opinion, to do
from the idol car,” I said. “Stupid,” said the bearded man. But not everyone thinks so. We talked
about cars and came to the conclusion that if you really buy anything, it's the GAZ-69, an all-terrain vehicle, but they,
unfortunately not for sale. Then the hawk-nosed one asked: “Where do you work?” I answered. “Colossal! exclaimed the hunchback. - Programmer! We need a programmer. Listen, leave your institute and come to us!” “What do you have?” “What do we have?” - asked the hook-nosed
turning around. "Aldan-3," said the bearded one. “Rich car,” I said. “And does it work well?”
- "Yes, how can I tell you ..." - "Understood," - I said. “Actually, it has not yet been debugged,” said the bearded one. - Stay with us, debug ... "-" And we will arrange the translation for you in no time, "- added the hook-nosed one. "What are you doing?" I asked. “Like all science,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Human happiness.” “Understood,” I said. “Something with space?” “And with space too,” he said.
hook-nosed. “They don’t look for good from good,” I said. “A capital city and a decent salary,” the bearded man said in a low voice, but I heard him. “No need,” I said. “You don’t have to measure for money.” - "Not really,
I was joking,” said the bearded man. “He's joking like that,” said the hawk-nosed one. - More interesting than ours
you won't be anywhere." - "Why do you think so?" - "Sure". “I'm not sure.” The hawk-nosed chuckled. “We will talk about this again,” he said. “Will you stay in Solovets for a long time?” - "Two days
maximum". “We’ll talk on the second day.” The bearded one said: “Personally, I see in this a finger
fate - walked through the forest and met a programmer. I think you are doomed." - "You really
do you need a programmer? I asked. "We desperately need a programmer." “I'll talk to the guys,” I promised. “I know those who are dissatisfied.” “We don't need just any programmer,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Programmers are a scarce people, they are spoiled, but we need an unspoilt one.” - "Yes it
harder,” I said. The hawk-nosed began to bend his fingers: “We need a programmer: a - not spoiled-

one hundred and twenty rubles. “What about wings? I asked. “Or, shall we say, lights around the head?” One in a thousand!" “We only need one,” said the hawk-nosed one. “And if there are only nine hundred of them?” “Nine-tenths agree.”
The forest parted, we crossed the bridge and rolled between the potato fields. "Nine
hours,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Where are you going to spend the night?” “I'll sleep in the car. Shops near
until what time do they work for you?" “Our shops are already closed,” said the hawk-nosed one. "It is possible in
hostel, - said the bearded man. “I have an empty bed in my room.” “You can’t drive up to the hostel,” said the hawk-nosed man thoughtfully. “Yes, perhaps,” said the bearded man, and for some reason laughed.
“The car can be parked near the police,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Yes, this is nonsense,” said the bearded man. - I'm talking nonsense, and you follow me. How will he get into the hostel? “Y-yeah, hell,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Really, if you don’t work for a day, you forget about all these things.” – “Maybe
maybe transgress it? “Well, well,” said the hawk-nosed one. This is not your sofa. And you are not Cristobal Junta, and neither am I ... "
“Don't worry,” I said. I'll sleep in the car, not the first time.
I suddenly felt like sleeping on sheets. I've been sleeping in the bedroom for four nights
bag.
“Listen,” said the hook-nosed one, “ho-ho!” Out of the knife!
- Right! exclaimed the bearded man. - On Lukomorye it!
"By God, I'll sleep in the car," I said.
“You will spend the night in the house,” said the hawk-nosed one, “on relatively clean linen. Should we
thank you somehow...
“It’s not a fifty kopeck for you to poke,” said the bearded one.
We entered the city. Ancient strong fences stretched out, powerful log cabins made of giant blackened logs, with narrow windows, with carved platbands, with wooden cockerels on
roofs. I came across several dirty brick buildings with iron doors, the sight of which brought the semi-familiar word "storage" out of my memory. The street was straight and wide and was called Mira Avenue. Ahead, closer to the center, one could see two-story cinder-block houses with open
public gardens.
“Next alley to the right,” said the hawk-nosed one.
I turned on the turn signal, braked and turned right. The road here is overgrown with grass,
but at some gate stood, crouching, a brand new "Zaporozhets". House numbers hung over the gates, and the numbers were barely visible on the rusty tin of the signs. The lane was elegantly called: “St.
Lukomorye. It was not wide and wedged between heavy old fences, set up, probably
back in the days when Swedish and Norwegian pirates roamed here.
“Stop,” said the hawk-nosed one. I braked and he bumped his nose against the barrel of the gun again. - Now
yes,” he said, rubbing his nose. - You wait for me, and I'll go and arrange everything.
“Really, it’s not worth it,” I said for the last time.
- No talking. Volodya, keep him at gunpoint.
Hook-nosed got out of the car and, bending down, squeezed through the low gate. Behind the tall
the gray fence of the house was not visible. The gates were absolutely phenomenal, as in a locomotive depot, on rusty iron hinges weighing a pound. I read the signs with amazement. There were three. On the left
In the gate, a solid blue signboard with silver letters sternly gleamed with thick glass:
NIICHAVO
Hut on chicken legs
Monument of Solovetsky antiquity
A rusty tin plate hung on top of the right collar: “St. Lukomorye, d. No. 13, N. K.
Gorynych”, and under it was a piece of plywood with an inscription at random in ink:
CAT DOES NOT WORK
Administration
- What CAT? I asked. – Committee of Defense Technology?
The bearded man chuckled.
"You don't have to worry," he said. “It’s funny here, but everything will be all right.I got out of the car and began to wipe the windshield. Above my head they were suddenly imported. I
looked. On the gates he anointed himself, making himself comfortable, a gigantic one - I have never seen such
- black-gray, with divorces, cat. Sitting down, he looked at me with his yellow eyes full and indifferent. “Kiss-kiss-kiss,” I said mechanically. The cat politely and coldly opened its toothy mouth,
hoarse throat sound, and then turned away and began to look inside the courtyard. From there, behind the fence, the voice
hunchbacked said:
- Vasily, my friend, let me disturb you.
The bolt screeched. The cat got up and silently disappeared into the yard. The gates swayed heavily, resounded
a terrifying creak and crack, and the left gate slowly opened. A face red from exertion appeared
hook-nosed.
- Benefactor! he called. - Come on in!
I got back in the car and drove slowly into the yard. The yard was vast, in the depths stood a house made of
thick logs, and in front of the house was a squat, immense oak, wide, dense, with a dense crown that obscured the roof. From the gate to the house, skirting the oak, there was a path lined with stone slabs. To the right of the path was a garden, and to the left, in the middle of the lawn, rose a well
a log house with a gate, black from antiquity and covered with moss.
I parked the car on the side, turned off the engine and got out. Bearded Volodya also got out and,
leaning the gun against the side, he began to adjust the backpack.
“Here you are at home,” he said.
Hook-nosed with a creak and crackling shut the gate, while I, feeling rather awkward, looked around, not knowing what to do.
- And here is the hostess! cried the bearded man. - How are you, grandma, Naina is the light of Kievna!
The owner must have been over a hundred. She walked towards us slowly, leaning on a knotted stick, dragging
feet in felt boots with galoshes. Her face was dark brown; from a continuous mass of wrinkles, a nose protruded forward and downward, crooked and sharp, like a scimitar, and the eyes were pale, dull, as if covered with thorns.
“Hello, hello, granddaughters,” she said in an unexpectedly sonorous bass. - This means,
and there will be a new programmer? Hello father, welcome!
I bowed, knowing that I needed to keep quiet. Grandmother's head over a black downy shawl,
tied under the chin, was covered with a cheerful nylon scarf with multi-colored
images of the Atomium and with inscriptions in different languages: "International Exhibition in Brussels".
A sparse gray stubble protruded from his chin and under his nose. The grandmother was dressed in a wadded sleeveless jacket and
black cloth dress.
- In this way, Naina Kievna! said the hawk-nosed one, coming up and wiping the rust from his palms. - We need to arrange for our new employee for two nights. Let me introduce you... mmm...
“But don’t,” said the old woman, examining me intently. - I see it myself. Privalov Alexander Ivanovich, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eighth, male, Russian, member of the Komsomol, no, no,
did not participate, was not, does not have, but it will be for you, diamond, a long journey and interest in a state-owned house, and
you, diamond, should be afraid of a red-haired, unkind person, but gild the pen, yakhontovy ...
- Hmm! the hawk-nosed one said loudly, and the grandmother broke off. There was an awkward silence.
- You can just call Sasha ... - I squeezed out a pre-prepared phrase.
“And where do I put it?” Grandma asked.
“In the storeroom, of course,” the hawk-nosed man said somewhat irritably.
- And who will answer?
- Naina Kievna! .. - the hawk-nosed roared with the peals of a provincial tragedian, grabbed the old woman
by the hand and dragged to the house. They could be heard arguing: "After all, we agreed! .." - "... And
if he steals something? ..” - “Yes, you be quiet! It's a programmer, right? Komsomolets!
Scientist! .. "-" And if he pokes? .. "
I shyly turned to Volodya. Volodya giggled.
“It’s kind of awkward,” I said.
Don't worry, everything will be fine...
He wanted to say something else, but then the grandmother yelled wildly: “A sofa, a sofa! ..” I shuddered and
said:
“You know, I should probably go, huh?
- Out of the question! Volodya said decisively. - It'll all work out. Grandma just needs
bribe, and Roman and I don't have cash.
“I will pay,” I said. Now I really wanted to leave: I can’t stand these so-called
life conflicts.
Volodya shook his head.
- Nothing like this. He's already on his way. Everything is fine.
Hook-nosed Roman came up to us, took my hand and said:
- Well, everything is fine. Went.
“Listen, it’s uncomfortable somehow,” I said. She doesn't have to, after all...
But we were already on our way home.
“I have to, I have to,” Roman said.
We rounded the oak tree and reached the back porch. Roman pushed open the leatherette-lined door, and we
found themselves in a hallway, spacious and clean, but poorly lit. The old woman was waiting for us with her hands folded
on his stomach and pursed his lips. When she saw us, she boomed vindictively:
- And a receipt to immediately! .. So, they say, and so: they supposedly accepted this and that from such and such, which handed over the above to the undersigned ...
Roman howled softly, and we entered the room allotted to me. It was a cool room with one window, hung with a cotton curtain. Roman said in a tense voice:
- Relax and make yourself at home.
The old woman from the hall immediately inquired jealously:
“But they don’t click their teeth?”
Roman, without turning around, barked:
- Don't chirp! They tell you there are no teeth.
- Then let's go, write a receipt ...
Roman raised his eyebrows, rolled his eyes, bared his teeth and shook his head, but went out anyway. I looked around. There was little furniture in the room. By the window stood a massive table covered with shabby gray
fringed tablecloth, in front of the table - a rickety stool. Near the bare log wall there was a large sofa, on the other wall, covered with wallpaper of various sizes, there was a hanger with some kind of junk (quilted jackets, fur coats that came out, tattered caps and earflaps). A large Russian stove, shining with fresh whitewash, protruded into the room, and opposite in the corner hung a large dim mirror in a shabby
frame. The floor was scraped and covered with striped rugs.
Behind the wall they muttered in two voices: the old woman bassed on one note, Roman's voice rose and fell. “Tablecloth, inventory number two hundred and forty-five ...” - “You still write down every floorboard! ..” - “Dinner table ...” - “Will you also write down the oven? ..” - “Order is needed ... Sofa ...”
I went to the window and drew back the curtain. There was an oak tree outside the window, nothing else was visible. I
began to look at the oak. It was apparently a very ancient plant. The bark on it was gray and somehow
dead, and the monstrous roots that crawled out of the ground were covered with red and white lichen. "AND
write down another oak!” Roman said behind the wall. There was a plump greasy book on the windowsill, I
thoughtlessly leafed through it, moved away from the window and sat down on the sofa. And now I want to sleep. I thought,
that he had been driving for fourteen hours today, that he should not have been in such a hurry, that his back
it hurts me, but everything is confused in my head, that I don’t give a damn about this tedious old woman, and it would soon be over and I could lie down and fall asleep ...
- Well, - said Roman, appearing on the threshold. - The formalities are over. - He waved his hand.
with splayed fingers smeared with ink. - Our fingers are tired: we wrote, we wrote ... Go to bed. We leave, and you calmly go to bed. What are you doing tomorrow?
"I'm waiting," I answered languidly.
- Where?
- Here. And near the post office.
“You won’t leave tomorrow, will you?”
- Tomorrow is unlikely ... Most likely - the day after tomorrow.
"Then we'll see you again." Our love is ahead. He smiled, waved his hand and left. I
lazily thought that it would be necessary to see him off and say goodbye to Volodya, and lay down. Just then an old woman entered the room. I wake up. The old woman looked at me for some time.
“I’m afraid, father, that you’ll start to bark your teeth,” she said with concern.
“I won’t poke,” I said wearily. - I'm going to sleep.
- And lie down and sleep ... Just pay the money and sleep ...
I reached into my back pocket for my wallet.
- How much do I have to pay?
The old woman raised her eyes to the ceiling.
- We'll put a ruble for the room ... Fifty dollars for bed linen - it's mine, not state-owned. Behind
two nights it comes out three rubles...
I know…
I handed her a five.
“So far, a ruble from generosity,” I said. - And it will be seen there.
The old woman quickly grabbed the money and walked away, muttering something about change. She wasn't pretty
for a long time, and I already wanted to give up both change and linen, but she returned and laid a handful of dirty coppers on the table.
“Here’s your change, father,” she said. - Exactly a ruble, you can not count.
“I won’t count,” I said. - What about underwear?
- I'll make a bed now. You go out into the yard, take a walk, and I will make a bed.
I went out, pulling out cigarettes as I went. The sun finally set, and the white night came. Somewhere
dogs barked. I sat down under an oak tree on a bench that had grown into the ground, lit a cigarette and began to look at the pale, starless sky. A cat appeared noiselessly from somewhere, looked at me with fluorescent eyes, then quickly climbed up the oak tree and disappeared into the dark foliage. I immediately forgot about him and shuddered when he was brought somewhere upstairs. Debris fell on my head. "To you ..." - I said aloud and
began to shake off. I was extremely anxious to sleep. An old woman came out of the house, not noticing me, wandered to
well. I understood this to mean that the bed was ready, and returned to the room.
The bad old lady made a bed for me on the floor. Well, no, I thought, locked the door on the latch, dragged the bed onto the sofa and began to undress. A gloomy light fell from the window, a cat bustled noisily on the oak.
I shook my head, shaking the debris out of my hair. It was strange garbage, unexpected: large dry fish scales. It will be a good sleep, I thought, I fell on the pillow and immediately fell asleep.Chapter Two
... The empty house has turned into a den of foxes and badgers, and therefore strange
werewolves and ghosts.
A. UedaI woke up in the middle of the night because they were talking in the room. The two were talking, barely
audible whisper. The voices were very similar, but one was a little choked and hoarse, and
the other showed extreme irritation.
"Don't wheeze," he whispered, irritated. – Can you not wheeze?
“I can,” the strangled man replied and snorted.
“Be quiet…” he hissed, irritated.
“A hoarse one,” explained the strangled man. “Smoker's morning cough…” He suffocated again.
“Get out of here,” said the irritated one.
Yes, he's still sleeping...
- Who is he? Where did it fall from?
– How do I know?
- That's a shame ... Well, just phenomenally unlucky.
Again, the neighbors can not sleep, I thought awake. I imagined that I was at home. At home in my neighbors
two physicist brothers who love to work at night. By two in the morning they run out of cigarettes, and then they climb into my room and begin to fumble, banging furniture and arguing.
I grabbed a pillow and threw it into the void. Something crashed down with a noise, and it became quiet.
“Give back the pillow,” I said, “and get out. Cigarettes on the table.
The sound of my own voice woke me completely. I sat down. Dogs barked dejectedly, behind the wall
the old woman snored ominously. I finally remembered where I was. There was no one in the room. In the twilight light, I saw my pillow on the floor and the junk that had fallen from the hanger. Grandma will tear off her head
I thought and jumped up. The floor was cold and I stepped onto the rugs. Grandma stopped snoring. I
froze. The floorboards crackled, something crunched and rustled in the corners. Grandma whistled deafeningly
and snored again. I picked up the pillow and threw it on the sofa. The junk smelled of dog. The hanger fell off the nail and hung sideways. I corrected it and began to pick up junk. As soon as I hung the last
the cloak, like a hanger, broke off and, shuffling against the wallpaper, again hung on one nail. Grandma stopped
snoring, and I broke out in a cold sweat. Somewhere nearby, a rooster crowed. Into your soup, I thought with hatred. The old woman behind the wall began to spin, the springs creaked and clicked. I waited on one leg. In the courtyard, someone said quietly: "It's time to sleep, we've been sitting too long today." The voice was
young, feminine. “Sleep like that,” said another voice. A long yawn was heard. -
Won't you splash anymore today?" - "Something's cold. Come on guys." It became quiet. Grandma for-
snarled and grunted, and I cautiously returned to the sofa. I'll get up early in the morning and fix everything
should...
I lay down on my right side, pulled the blanket over my ear, closed my eyes and suddenly realized that I didn’t feel like sleeping at all - I wanted to eat. Ayyyyyyy, I thought. It was necessary to urgently take action, and I
accepted.
Here, let's say, is a system of two integral equations of the type of stellar statistics equations; both
unknown functions are under the integral. Of course, one can only solve numerically, say, at BESM... I remembered our BESM. Custard color control panel. Zhenya puts
on this panel a bundle of newspaper and unhurriedly unfolds it. "What do you have?" - "I have with cheese and
sausage." With Polish half-smoked, circles. “Hey, you need to get married! I have cutlets, with garlic, homemade. And pickles." No, two cucumbers ... Four cutlets and for good measure
four strong pickled cucumbers. And four slices of bread and butter...
I threw back the covers and sat up. Maybe there is something left in the car? No, everything that was there, I
ate. There was a cookbook for Valka's mother, who lives in Lezhnev. How is it there ... Sauce
pickan. Half a glass of vinegar, two onions ... and pepper. Served with meat dishes ... As I remember now: with small steaks. What a meanness, I thought, not just to steaks, but to small steaks. I jumped up and ran to the window. The night air smelled distinctly of little steaks. From somewhere in the depths of the subconscious surfaced: “He was served ordinary
dishes in restaurants, such as: sour cabbage soup, brains with peas, pickled cucumber (I took a sip) and the eternal puff sweet pie ... ”I would be distracted, I thought, and took the book from the windowsill. It was Alex
Tolstoy, Gloomy Morning. I opened at random. “Makhno, breaking the sardine key, pulled out of his pocket
mother-of-pearl knife with fifty blades and continued to wield it, opening tins of pineapples (bad business, I thought), French pate, with lobsters, from which there was a sharp smell around the room. I carefully put the book down and sat down at the table on a stool. Delicious food suddenly appeared in the room
pungent smell: it must have smelled like lobster. I began to wonder why I had never tasted lobster until now. Or, say, oysters. In Dickens's, everyone eats oysters, wields folding knives, cuts off thick slices of bread, spreads it with butter ... I began to nervously smooth the tablecloth. On the tablecloth
unwashed spots were visible. They ate a lot and deliciously. Ate lobsters and brains with peas. They ate small steaks with pican sauce. Large and medium steaks were also eaten. Satiated puffed
satisfactorily clicked their teeth ... I had nothing to take the rap from, and I began to click my teeth.
I must have done it loud and hungry, because the old woman behind the wall creaked the bed,
she muttered angrily, rattled something, and suddenly came into my room. She wore a long gray
shirt, and in her hands she carried a plate, and the real, and not fantastic, aroma of food immediately spread in the room. The old woman smiled. She set the plate right in front of me and sweetly boomed:
- Take a bite, father, Alexander Ivanovich. Eat what God sent, sent with me ...
“What are you, what are you, Naina Kievna,” I muttered, “why did you bother yourself so much ...
But in my hand I already had a fork with a bone handle from somewhere, and I began to eat, and the grandmother stood
nearby, nodding and saying:
- Eat, father, eat in good health ...
I ate everything. It was a hot potato with ghee.
“Naina Kievna,” I said earnestly, “you saved me from starvation.
- Have you eaten? said Naina Kievna somehow unfriendly.
- Ate great. Thank you very much! You cannot imagine...
“What can’t be imagined,” she interrupted, already completely irritated. Have you eaten, I say?
Well, give me a plate here ... A plate, I say, come on!
“For…please,” I said.
- "Please, please" ... Feed you here for please ...
“I can pay,” I said, getting angry.
- "Pay, pay" ... - She went to the door. What if they don't pay for it at all? And there's nothing
was lying...
- That is, how is it - to lie?
- And so lie! You said yourself that you won't tinkle…” She stopped talking and hid behind the door.
What is she? I thought. Some strange grandmother ... Maybe she noticed the hanger? Was
you can hear her creaking with springs, tossing and turning on the bed and grumbling with displeasure. Then she sang
softly to some barbaric motive: “I’ll ride, lie down, having eaten Ivashka’s meat ...” From
the windows were cold at night. I shivered, got up to return to the sofa, and then it dawned on me that I had locked the door before going to bed. Confused, I went to the door and stretched out my hand to check the latch, but as soon as my fingers touched the cold iron, everything swam before my eyes. It turned out that I was lying on the couch, with my nose buried in the pillow, and with my fingers I felt
cold log wall.
For some time I lay dying, until I realized that somewhere nearby an old woman was snoring, and they were talking in the room. Someone instructively spoke in an undertone:
- The elephant is the largest animal of all living on earth. He has a big one on his snout
a piece of meat called a trunk because it is empty and stretched out like a pipe. He stretches and bends it in all sorts of ways and uses it instead of a hand...
Cold with curiosity, I cautiously turned to my right side. The room was still empty. The voice continued even more instructively:
– Wine used in moderation is very good for the stomach; but when you drink too much of it, it produces vapors that degrade a person to the level of senseless beasts. Have you seen sometimes
drunkards and also remember that just disgust that you had for them ...
I jumped up and swung my legs off the couch. The voice is silent. It seemed to me that they were talking from somewhere behind the wall. Everything in the room was the same, even the hanger, to my surprise, hung on
place. And, to my surprise, I was very hungry again.
“Tincture ex vitro antimony,” a voice announced suddenly. I started. - Magiftherium Antimon Angelii Salae. Bafilia oleum vitry antimonia alexiterium antimoniale! - I heard
obvious giggle. - That's what nonsense! said the voice, and went on with a howl:
these eyes, still being opened, will no longer see the sun, but do not let it close without a sympathetic
notices of my forgiveness and bliss ... This is the "Spirit or Moral Thoughts of the Glorious Jung, extracted from his nightly reflections." Sold in St. Petersburg and Riga in bookstores
Sveshnikov's shops for two rubles in a folder. – Someone sobbed. "That's nonsense, too," said the voice, and
said with expression:
Ranks, beauty, wealth,
All the pleasures of this life
Flying, weakening, disappearing,
This is decay, and happiness is false!
Infections gnaw at the heart
And glory cannot be kept ...
Now I understand where they said. The voice came from a corner where a misty mirror hung.
“And now,” said the voice, “the next. “Everything is a single I, this I is the world I. Unity with ignorance, which comes from the eclipse of the light of I, disappears with the development of spirituality.”
- And where does this nonsense come from? I asked. I didn't expect an answer. I was sure that I was dreaming.
“Sayings from the Upanishads,” the voice answered readily.
What are the Upanishads? “I was no longer sure I was dreaming.
“I don't know,” the voice said.
I got up and tiptoed over to the mirror. I didn't see my reflection. The cloudy glass reflected the curtain, the corner of the stove, and many things in general. But I wasn't in it.
- What's the matter? the voice asked. - Have questions?
- Who is speaking? I asked looking behind the mirror. Behind the mirror there was a lot of dust and dead
spiders. Then I pressed my left eye with my index finger. It was an old rule for recognizing hallucinations, which I read in the fascinating book by V. V. Bitner "To believe or not to believe?". It is enough to press a finger on the eyeball, and all real objects - unlike
hallucinations - bifurcate. The mirror split in two, and my reflection appeared in it - sleepy,
anxious face. It blew down my legs. Cursing my fingers, I went to the window and looked out.
There was no one outside the window, not even an oak tree. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. I distinctly
I saw right in front of me a mossy well log house with a gate, a gate and my car at the gate. I'm still asleep, I thought calmly. My gaze fell on the windowsill, on the disheveled book. In pro-
in my last dream it was the third volume of the Pain, now on the cover I read: “P. I. Karpov.
Creativity of the mentally ill and its influence on the development of science, art and technology. Teeth chattering from the chill, I leafed through the book and looked through the colored inserts. Then I read "Verse #2":
In the circle of clouds high
black-winged sparrow
Trembling and lonely
Soars quickly above the ground.
He flies at night
Illuminated by moonlight,
And, dismayed by nothing,
He sees everything below him.
Proud, predatory, furious
And flying like a shadow
Eyes glow like day.
The floor suddenly swayed under my feet. There was a piercing lingering creak, then, like the rumble of a distant earthquake, there was a roaring: “Ko-o… Ko-o… Ko-o…” The hut shook like a boat on the waves. The yard outside the window moved to the side, and from under the window climbed out and stuck
claws into the ground, a gigantic chicken leg, made deep furrows in the grass and disappeared again. Floor
lurched steeply, I felt that I was falling, grabbed something soft with my hands, hit my side and
head and fell off the couch. I was lying on the rugs, clutching the pillow that had fallen along with
me. The room was completely light. Outside the window, someone was clearing his throat.
“Well, well…” said a well-trained male voice. - In some there was a kingdom, in some state there lived a king, by name ... me-eh ... well, in the end, it doesn’t matter. Let's say, mne... Poluekt... He had three sons, princes. The first one… me-uh… The third one was a fool, but the first one?..
Bending down like a soldier under fire, I crept up to the window and looked out. The oak was there.
With his back to him, the cat Vasily stood on his hind legs in deep thought. He had a water lily in his teeth. The cat looked at his feet and pulled: "Mne-uh ..." Then he shook his head,
he put his front paws behind his back and, stooping slightly, like assistant professor Dubino-Knyazhitsky at a lecture, walked with a smooth step away from the oak.
“Okay…” the cat said through clenched teeth. - There was a king and a queen. The king, the queen had
one son… Mne-eh… Fool, of course…
The cat spat out the flower in annoyance and rubbed his forehead, grimacing all over.
“A desperate situation,” he said. - I do remember something! “Ha ha ha! There will be something to eat: a horse for lunch, well done for dinner ... ”Where would it come from? And Ivan, you yourself understand - a fool, replies: "Oh, you filthy monster, not catching a white swan, but eat!" Then, of course - red-hot
an arrow, all three heads off, Ivan takes out three hearts and brings, cretin, home to his mother ... What
present! The cat laughed sardonically, then sighed. - There is another disease - sclerosis - he said.
He sighed again, turned back to the oak and sang: “Quack, quack, my little children! Quack, quack, pigeons! I… mne-uh… I soldered you with a tear… or rather, soldered you…” He sighed for the third time and walked in silence for a while. Coming up with the oak, he suddenly yelled unmusically: “Sweet bite is not
finished eating!.. "
He suddenly had a massive harp in his paws - I didn’t even notice where he got them. He desperately hit them with his paw and, clinging to the strings with his claws, yelled even louder, as if trying to drown out the music:
Dass im tannwald finster east,
Das macht das holts,
Das… meh… mein shatz… or katz?..
He fell silent and walked for some time, silently tapping on the strings. Then, softly, hesitantly, he sang:
Oh, I'm in the same garden,
I'll tell you the whole truth:
Oto so
Dig poppy.
He returned to the oak, leaned his harp against it, and scratched behind his ear with his back foot.
“Work, work, work,” he said. - Only work!
He put his paws behind his back again and walked to the left of the oak, muttering:
- It came to me, O great king, that in the glorious city of Baghdad there lived a tailor, named ...
He got on all fours, arched his back, and hissed angrily. - With these names I have especially
disgusting! Abu... Ali... Someone ibn someone... W-well, let's say Poluekt. Poluekt ibn…
me-uh… Poluektovich… I still don’t remember what happened to this tailor. Well, the dog is with him, let's start another ...
I lay on my stomach on the windowsill and, sighing, watched the unfortunate Vasily wander around the oak, now to the right, then to the left, muttering, clearing his throat, howling, mooing, becoming tense on
on all fours - in a word, it suffers unspeakably. The range of his knowledge was enormous. Not a single fairy tale
he did not know a single song more than half, but they were Russian, Ukrainian, West Slavic, German, English, in my opinion, even Japanese, Chinese and African fairy tales, legends, parables, ballads, songs, romances, ditties and refrains. Sclerosis made him furious,
several times he threw himself on the trunk of an oak and tore the bark with his claws, he hissed and spat, and his eyes
they burned like those of the devil, and the fluffy tail, thick as a log, now looked at the zenith, then convulsively
twitched, then whipped him on the sides. But the only song he sang to the end was
"Chizhik-Pyzhik", and the only fairy tale that he coherently told was "The House That Jack Built" in Marshak's translation, and even then with some cuts. Gradually - apparently from fatigue - his speech acquired an increasingly distinct cat accent. “And in poly, poly,” he sang, “himself
plow plow, a ... mne-e ... a ... mne-a-a-u! .. and behind that plow he himself ... mya-a-u-a-u!
Or Brode?.. ”In the end, he was completely exhausted, sat on his tail and sat there for a while, hanging his head. Then he meowed softly, sadly, took the harp under his arm and slowly hobbled along the dewy grass on three legs.
I climbed off the windowsill and dropped the book. I distinctly remember that the last time it was
"Creativity of the mentally ill", I was sure that this book fell on the floor. But I picked
put on the windowsill "Crimes Disclosure" by A. Swenson and O. Wendel. I stupidly opened it
I ran through several paragraphs at random, and at once it seemed to me that a strangled man was hanging on an oak tree. I
