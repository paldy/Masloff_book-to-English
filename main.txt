" “I'll talk to the guys,” I promised.  “I know those who are dissatisfied. ” “We don't need just any programmer,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Programmers are a scarce people, they are spoiled, but we need an unspoilt one. ” - "Yes it
harder,” I said.  The hawk-nosed began to bend his fingers: “We need a programmer: a - not spoiled-

ny, be - volunteer, tse - to agree to live in a hostel . . .  "-" De, - picked up the bearded one, -
one hundred and twenty rubles.  “What about wings? I asked.  “Or, shall we say, lights around the head?” One in a thousand!" “We only need one,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “And if there are only nine hundred of them?” “Nine-tenths agree. ”
The forest parted, we crossed the bridge and rolled between the potato fields.  "Nine
hours,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Where are you going to spend the night?” “I'll sleep in the car.  Shops near
until what time do they work for you?" “Our shops are already closed,” said the hawk-nosed one.  "It is possible in
hostel, - said the bearded man.  “I have an empty bed in my room. ” “You can’t drive up to the hostel,” said the hawk-nosed man thoughtfully.  “Yes, perhaps,” said the bearded man, and for some reason laughed. 
“The car can be parked near the police,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Yes, this is nonsense,” said the bearded man.  - I'm talking nonsense, and you follow me.  How will he get into the hostel? “Y-yeah, hell,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Really, if you don’t work for a day, you forget about all these things. ” – “Maybe
maybe transgress it? “Well, well,” said the hawk-nosed one.  This is not your sofa.  And you are not Cristobal Junta, and neither am I . . .  "
“Don't worry,” I said.  I'll sleep in the car, not the first time. 
I suddenly felt like sleeping on sheets.  I've been sleeping in the bedroom for four nights
bag. 
“Listen,” said the hook-nosed one, “ho-ho!” Out of the knife!
- Right! exclaimed the bearded man.  - On Lukomorye it!
"By God, I'll sleep in the car," I said. 
“You will spend the night in the house,” said the hawk-nosed one, “on relatively clean linen.  Should we
thank you somehow. . . 
“It’s not a fifty kopeck for you to poke,” said the bearded one. 
We entered the city.  Ancient strong fences stretched out, powerful log cabins made of giant blackened logs, with narrow windows, with carved platbands, with wooden cockerels on
roofs.  I came across several dirty brick buildings with iron doors, the sight of which brought the semi-familiar word "storage" out of my memory.  The street was straight and wide and was called Mira Avenue.  Ahead, closer to the center, one could see two-story cinder-block houses with open
public gardens. 
“Next alley to the right,” said the hawk-nosed one. 
I turned on the turn signal, braked and turned right.  The road here is overgrown with grass,
but at some gate stood, crouching, a brand new "Zaporozhets".  House numbers hung over the gates, and the numbers were barely visible on the rusty tin of the signs.  The lane was elegantly called: “St. 
Lukomorye.  It was not wide and wedged between heavy old fences, set up, probably
back in the days when Swedish and Norwegian pirates roamed here . ". " The car shook and jumped.  Hook-nosed bruised his nose on the barrel of a gun.  The motor roared, the stones beat in
bottom.  "Poor car," said the hawk-nosed one.  “What to do…” I said.  “Not everyone would go
such a road in your car.  “I would go,” I said.  The spill is over.  "Oh, it's not yours. 
car," the hook-nosed man guessed.  “Well, how do I get a car! It's a rental. " “Understood,” he said. 
hook-nosed, as it seemed to me, disappointed.  I felt hurt.  “What’s the point of buying a car to drive on asphalt? Where there is asphalt, there is nothing interesting, and where it is interesting, there is no asphalt. ” “Yes, of course,” the hook-nosed man agreed politely.  "It's stupid, in my opinion, to do
from the idol car,” I said.  “Stupid,” said the bearded man.  But not everyone thinks so.  We talked
about cars and came to the conclusion that if you really buy anything, it's the GAZ-69, an all-terrain vehicle, but they,
unfortunately not for sale. 
“It’s kind of awkward,” I said. 
I threw back the covers and sat up.  - Exactly a ruble, you can not count.  Grandma will tear off her head
I thought and jumped up.  “Not everyone would go
such a road in your car.  “Your coat is pinched.  “Tablecloth, inventory number two hundred and forty-five . 
We entered the city. 
“Here’s your change, father,” she said. .  “Where are you going to spend the night?” “I'll sleep in the car. ” “Do you have relatives there or
familiar?" “No,” I said.  Cigarettes on the table.  You go out into the yard, take a walk, and I will make a bed. .  K.  The spill is over.  It will be a good sleep, I thought, I fell on the pillow and immediately fell asleep.  “Yes, perhaps,” said the bearded man, and for some reason laughed. ”
I went to the window and drew back the curtain. " Our love is ahead. 
- Benefactor! - the hawk-nosed one said delightedly, took off his gun from his shoulder and sat down next to me.  “He's joking like that,” said the hawk-nosed one. ” “Yes, of course,” the hook-nosed man agreed politely.  A gloomy light fell from the window, a cat bustled noisily on the oak.  “He's joking like that,” said the hawk-nosed one.  I immediately forgot about him and shuddered when he was brought somewhere upstairs. ”
The forest parted, we crossed the bridge and rolled between the potato fields.  “A capital city and a decent salary,” the bearded man said in a low voice, but I heard him. .  I read the signs with amazement.  13, N.  - More interesting than ours
you won't be anywhere.  It will be a good sleep, I thought, I fell on the pillow and immediately fell asleep.  "To you .  A face red from exertion appeared
hook-nosed.  I let off the gas as I looked at them.  The old woman looked at me for some time.  It was necessary to urgently take action, and I
accepted.  The motor roared, the stones beat in
bottom. 
Hook-nosed Roman came up to us, took my hand and said:
- Well, everything is fine. 
Gorynych”, and under it was a piece of plywood with an inscription at random in ink:
CAT DOES NOT WORK
Administration


- What CAT? I asked. 
“In the storeroom, of course,” the hawk-nosed man said somewhat irritably.  Alexandra Privalova
brought up more than one generation of Russian scientists and charged with the light magic of the 60s the thoughts and aspirations of many
young warriors of science. . . 
“Next alley to the right,” said the hawk-nosed one.  The old woman behind the wall began to spin, the springs creaked and clicked.  “Sleep like that,” said another voice.  The junk smelled of dog. ” – “Maybe
maybe transgress it? “Well, well,” said the hawk-nosed one.  And
if he steals something? .  “Smoker's morning cough…” He suffocated again. 
“I won’t count,” I said. 
A. 

But what is strange, what is most incomprehensible, is how authors can take such plots,
I confess, this is completely incomprehensible, that's for sure .  It was apparently a very ancient plant. "
Ahead, I saw a large scattering of stones, slowed down and said: "Hold on tight. 
Don't worry, everything will be fine. 
N.  Fifty dollars for bed linen - it's mine, not state-owned.  I sat down under an oak tree on a bench that had grown into the ground, lit a cigarette and began to look at the pale, starless sky.  “This year the summer is dry, everything has dried up.  The floorboards crackled, something crunched and rustled in the corners.  Bearded Volodya also got out and,
leaning the gun against the side, he began to adjust the backpack. " No, two cucumbers .  I sat down under an oak tree on a bench that had grown into the ground, lit a cigarette and began to look at the pale, starless sky.  There was an awkward silence. .  And four slices of bread and butter. . 
On the right, two people came out of the forest, stepped onto the side of the road and stopped, looking in my direction.  “And does it work well?”
- "Yes, how can I tell you . 
I went out, pulling out cigarettes as I went.  I read the signs with amazement.  “Kiss-kiss-kiss,” I said mechanically.  - the hawk-nosed roared with the peals of a provincial tragedian, grabbed the old woman
by the hand and dragged to the house.  Somewhere
dogs barked.  Are you from Leningrad? - "Yes".  “I know those who are dissatisfied.  Are you from Leningrad? - "Yes".  “The road is quite decent,” I objected. .  And now I want to sleep. ” - “You still write down every floorboard! . . 
“Get out of here,” said the irritated one. 
- You can just call Sasha .  There was little furniture in the room.  I imagined that I was at home. 
I shook my head, shaking the debris out of my hair.  “Stupid,” said the bearded man.  “Stupid,” said the bearded man.  Into your soup, I thought with hatred. 
- Well, - said Roman, appearing on the threshold.  Well, no, I thought, locked the door on the latch, dragged the bed onto the sofa and began to undress. 
- In this way, Naina Kievna! said the hawk-nosed one, coming up and wiping the rust from his palms.  A face red from exertion appeared
hook-nosed.
