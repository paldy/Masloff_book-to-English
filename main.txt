Series: NIICHAVO - 1But what is strange, what is most incomprehensible, is how authors can take such plots,
I confess, this is completely incomprehensible, that's for sure ... no, no, I don’t understand at all.

THE FUSION AROUND THE SOFAChapter first
Teacher: Children, write down the sentence: "The fish was sitting on a tree."
Student: Do fish sit on trees?
Teacher: Well... It was a crazy fish.
School jokeI was approaching my destination. Around me, clinging to the very road, green
forest, occasionally giving way to clearings overgrown with yellow sedge. The sun has been setting for an hour now
still could not sit down and hung low over the horizon. The car rolled along a narrow road covered with crisp gravel. I let large stones under the wheel, and every time they clanged in the trunk
and empty canisters rumbled.
On the right, two people came out of the forest, stepped onto the side of the road and stopped, looking in my direction. One of
them raised their hand. I let off the gas as I looked at them. They were, it seemed to me, hunters, young
people maybe a little older than me. I liked their faces and I stopped. The one who raised his hand stuck his swarthy hook-nosed face into the car and asked, smiling:
- You will not give us a lift to Solovets?
The second, with a red beard and no mustache, was also smiling, peering over his shoulder. Positive-
but they were nice people.
"Let's sit down," I said. - One forward, the other back, otherwise I have junk there, in the back
seat.
- Benefactor! - the hawk-nosed one said delightedly, took off his gun from his shoulder and sat down next to me.
The bearded man, looking hesitantly through the back door, said:
“Can I have a little of that here?”
I leaned over the back and helped him clear the space occupied by the sleeping bag and the rolled-up tent. He sat down delicately, placing the gun between his knees.
“Close the door better,” I said.
Everything went on as usual. The car started off. The hawk-nosed man turned back and spoke animatedly about the fact that it is much more pleasant to ride in a passenger car than to walk. The bearded man indistinctly agreed and kept slamming and slamming the door. “Pick up your raincoat,” I advised, looking at him in the mirror.
rear view. “Your coat is pinched.” Five minutes later, everything finally settled down. I asked: "Before
Solovets ten kilometers? “Yes,” answered the hawk-nosed one. - Or a little more. The road is true

I won't go." “You can drive along this road even in autumn.” - “Here - perhaps, but from Korobets

bearded in the back seat. "Who is speaking?" asked the hawk-nosed one. Merlin speaks. They
for some reason they laughed. I pulled out cigarettes, lit a cigarette and offered them a treat. "Clara's Factory"
Zetkin,” said the hawk-nosed one, looking at the pack. Are you from Leningrad? - "Yes". - "Are you traveling?"
“I'm traveling,” I said. “Are you from here?” “Indigenous,” said the hawk-nosed one. "I'm from Murmansk," the bearded man said. “For Leningrad, probably, Solovets and Murmansk are one and the same:
North,” said the hawk-nosed one. "No, why not," I said politely. “Are you going to stop in Solovets?” asked the hawk-nosed one. “Of course,” I said. “I am going to Solovets.” “Do you have relatives there or
familiar?" “No,” I said. I'll just wait guys. They go along the coast, and Solovets is our dot
rendezvous."
Ahead, I saw a large scattering of stones, slowed down and said: "Hold on tight." The car shook and jumped. Hook-nosed bruised his nose on the barrel of a gun. The motor roared, the stones beat in
bottom. "Poor car," said the hawk-nosed one. “What to do…” I said. “Not everyone would go
such a road in your car. “I would go,” I said. The spill is over. "Oh, it's not yours.
car," the hook-nosed man guessed. “Well, how do I get a car! It's a rental." “Understood,” he said.
hook-nosed, as it seemed to me, disappointed. I felt hurt. “What’s the point of buying a car to drive on asphalt? Where there is asphalt, there is nothing interesting, and where it is interesting, there is no asphalt.” “Yes, of course,” the hook-nosed man agreed politely. "It's stupid, in my opinion, to do
from the idol car,” I said. “Stupid,” said the bearded man. But not everyone thinks so. We talked
about cars and came to the conclusion that if you really buy anything, it's the GAZ-69, an all-terrain vehicle, but they,
unfortunately not for sale. Then the hawk-nosed one asked: “Where do you work?” I answered. “Colossal! exclaimed the hunchback. - Programmer! We need a programmer. Listen, leave your institute and come to us!” “What do you have?” “What do we have?” - asked the hook-nosed
turning around. "Aldan-3," said the bearded one. “Rich car,” I said. “And does it work well?”
- "Yes, how can I tell you ..." - "Understood," - I said. “Actually, it has not yet been debugged,” said the bearded one. - Stay with us, debug ... "-" And we will arrange the translation for you in no time, "- added the hook-nosed one. "What are you doing?" I asked. “Like all science,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Human happiness.” “Understood,” I said. “Something with space?” “And with space too,” he said.
hook-nosed. “They don’t look for good from good,” I said. “A capital city and a decent salary,” the bearded man said in a low voice, but I heard him. “No need,” I said. “You don’t have to measure for money.” - "Not really,
I was joking,” said the bearded man. “He's joking like that,” said the hawk-nosed one. - More interesting than ours
you won't be anywhere." - "Why do you think so?" - "Sure". “I'm not sure.” The hawk-nosed chuckled. “We will talk about this again,” he said. “Will you stay in Solovets for a long time?” - "Two days
maximum". “We’ll talk on the second day.” The bearded one said: “Personally, I see in this a finger
fate - walked through the forest and met a programmer. I think you are doomed." - "You really
do you need a programmer? I asked. "We desperately need a programmer." “I'll talk to the guys,” I promised. “I know those who are dissatisfied.” “We don't need just any programmer,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Programmers are a scarce people, they are spoiled, but we need an unspoilt one.” - "Yes it
harder,” I said. The hawk-nosed began to bend his fingers: “We need a programmer: a - not spoiled-

one hundred and twenty rubles. “What about wings? I asked. “Or, shall we say, lights around the head?” One in a thousand!" “We only need one,” said the hawk-nosed one. “And if there are only nine hundred of them?” “Nine-tenths agree.”
The forest parted, we crossed the bridge and rolled between the potato fields. "Nine
hours,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Where are you going to spend the night?” “I'll sleep in the car. Shops near
until what time do they work for you?" “Our shops are already closed,” said the hawk-nosed one. "It is possible in
hostel, - said the bearded man. “I have an empty bed in my room.” “You can’t drive up to the hostel,” said the hawk-nosed man thoughtfully. “Yes, perhaps,” said the bearded man, and for some reason laughed.
“The car can be parked near the police,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Yes, this is nonsense,” said the bearded man. - I'm talking nonsense, and you follow me. How will he get into the hostel? “Y-yeah, hell,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Really, if you don’t work for a day, you forget about all these things.” – “Maybe
maybe transgress it? “Well, well,” said the hawk-nosed one. This is not your sofa. And you are not Cristobal Junta, and neither am I ... "
“Don't worry,” I said. I'll sleep in the car, not the first time.
I suddenly felt like sleeping on sheets. I've been sleeping in the bedroom for four nights
bag.
“Listen,” said the hook-nosed one, “ho-ho!” Out of the knife!
- Right! exclaimed the bearded man. - On Lukomorye it!
"By God, I'll sleep in the car," I said.
“You will spend the night in the house,” said the hawk-nosed one, “on relatively clean linen. Should we
thank you somehow...
“It’s not a fifty kopeck for you to poke,” said the bearded one.
We entered the city. Ancient strong fences stretched out, powerful log cabins made of giant blackened logs, with narrow windows, with carved platbands, with wooden cockerels on
roofs. I came across several dirty brick buildings with iron doors, the sight of which brought the semi-familiar word "storage" out of my memory. The street was straight and wide and was called Mira Avenue. Ahead, closer to the center, one could see two-story cinder-block houses with open
public gardens.
“Next alley to the right,” said the hawk-nosed one.
I turned on the turn signal, braked and turned right. The road here is overgrown with grass,
but at some gate stood, crouching, a brand new "Zaporozhets". House numbers hung over the gates, and the numbers were barely visible on the rusty tin of the signs. The lane was elegantly called: “St.
Lukomorye. It was not wide and wedged between heavy old fences, set up, probably
back in the days when Swedish and Norwegian pirates roamed here.
“Stop,” said the hawk-nosed one. I braked and he bumped his nose against the barrel of the gun again. - Now
yes,” he said, rubbing his nose. - You wait for me, and I'll go and arrange everything.
“Really, it’s not worth it,” I said for the last time.
- No talking. Volodya, keep him at gunpoint.
Hook-nosed got out of the car and, bending down, squeezed through the low gate. Behind the tall
the gray fence of the house was not visible. The gates were absolutely phenomenal, as in a locomotive depot, on rusty iron hinges weighing a pound. I read the signs with amazement. There were three. On the left
In the gate, a solid blue signboard with silver letters sternly gleamed with thick glass:
NIICHAVO
Hut on chicken legs
Monument of Solovetsky antiquity
A rusty tin plate hung on top of the right collar: “St. Lukomorye, d. No. 13, N. K.
Gorynych”, and under it was a piece of plywood with an inscription at random in ink:
CAT DOES NOT WORK
Administration
- What CAT? I asked. – Committee of Defense Technology?
The bearded man chuckled.
"You don't have to worry," he said. “It’s funny here, but everything will be all right.I got out of the car and began to wipe the windshield. Above my head they were suddenly imported. I
looked. On the gates he anointed himself, making himself comfortable, a gigantic one - I have never seen such
- black-gray, with divorces, cat. Sitting down, he looked at me with his yellow eyes full and indifferent. “Kiss-kiss-kiss,” I said mechanically. The cat politely and coldly opened its toothy mouth,
hoarse throat sound, and then turned away and began to look inside the courtyard. From there, behind the fence, the voice
hunchbacked said:
- Vasily, my friend, let me disturb you.
The bolt screeched. The cat got up and silently disappeared into the yard. The gates swayed heavily, resounded
a terrifying creak and crack, and the left gate slowly opened. A face red from exertion appeared
hook-nosed.
- Benefactor! he called. - Come on in!
I got back in the car and drove slowly into the yard. The yard was vast, in the depths stood a house made of
thick logs, and in front of the house was a squat, immense oak, wide, dense, with a dense crown that obscured the roof. From the gate to the house, skirting the oak, there was a path lined with stone slabs. To the right of the path was a garden, and to the left, in the middle of the lawn, rose a well
a log house with a gate, black from antiquity and covered with moss.
I parked the car on the side, turned off the engine and got out. Bearded Volodya also got out and,
leaning the gun against the side, he began to adjust the backpack.
“Here you are at home,” he said.
Hook-nosed with a creak and crackling shut the gate, while I, feeling rather awkward, looked around, not knowing what to do.
- And here is the hostess! cried the bearded man. - How are you, grandma, Naina is the light of Kievna!
The owner must have been over a hundred. She walked towards us slowly, leaning on a knotted stick, dragging
feet in felt boots with galoshes. Her face was dark brown; from a continuous mass of wrinkles, a nose protruded forward and downward, crooked and sharp, like a scimitar, and the eyes were pale, dull, as if covered with thorns.
“Hello, hello, granddaughters,” she said in an unexpectedly sonorous bass. - This means,
and there will be a new programmer? Hello father, welcome!
I bowed, knowing that I needed to keep quiet. Grandmother's head over a black downy shawl,
tied under the chin, was covered with a cheerful nylon scarf with multi-colored
images of the Atomium and with inscriptions in different languages: "International Exhibition in Brussels".
A sparse gray stubble protruded from his chin and under his nose. The grandmother was dressed in a wadded sleeveless jacket and
black cloth dress.
- In this way, Naina Kievna! said the hawk-nosed one, coming up and wiping the rust from his palms. - We need to arrange for our new employee for two nights. Let me introduce you... mmm...
“But don’t,” said the old woman, examining me intently. - I see it myself. Privalov Alexander Ivanovich, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eighth, male, Russian, member of the Komsomol, no, no,
did not participate, was not, does not have, but it will be for you, diamond, a long journey and interest in a state-owned house, and
you, diamond, should be afraid of a red-haired, unkind person, but gild the pen, yakhontovy ...
- Hmm! the hawk-nosed one said loudly, and the grandmother broke off. There was an awkward silence.
- You can just call Sasha ... - I squeezed out a pre-prepared phrase.
“And where do I put it?” Grandma asked.
“In the storeroom, of course,” the hawk-nosed man said somewhat irritably.
- And who will answer?
- Naina Kievna! .. - the hawk-nosed roared with the peals of a provincial tragedian, grabbed the old woman
by the hand and dragged to the house. They could be heard arguing: "After all, we agreed! .." - "... And
if he steals something? ..” - “Yes, you be quiet! It's a programmer, right? Komsomolets!
Scientist! .. "-" And if he pokes? .. "
I shyly turned to Volodya. Volodya giggled.
“It’s kind of awkward,” I said.
Don't worry, everything will be fine...
He wanted to say something else, but then the grandmother yelled wildly: “A sofa, a sofa! ..” I shuddered and
said:
“You know, I should probably go, huh?
- Out of the question! Volodya said decisively. - It'll all work out. Grandma just needs
bribe, and Roman and I don't have cash.
“I will pay,” I said. Now I really wanted to leave: I can’t stand these so-called
life conflicts.
Volodya shook his head.
- Nothing like this. He's already on his way. Everything is fine.
Hook-nosed Roman came up to us, took my hand and said:
- Well, everything is fine. Went.
“Listen, it’s uncomfortable somehow,” I said. She doesn't have to, after all...
But we were already on our way home.
“I have to, I have to,” Roman said.
We rounded the oak tree and reached the back porch. Roman pushed open the leatherette-lined door, and we
found themselves in a hallway, spacious and clean, but poorly lit. The old woman was waiting for us with her hands folded
on his stomach and pursed his lips. When she saw us, she boomed vindictively:
- And a receipt to immediately! .. So, they say, and so: they supposedly accepted this and that from such and such, which handed over the above to the undersigned ...
Roman howled softly, and we entered the room allotted to me. It was a cool room with one window, hung with a cotton curtain. Roman said in a tense voice:
- Relax and make yourself at home.
The old woman from the hall immediately inquired jealously:
“But they don’t click their teeth?”
Roman, without turning around, barked:
- Don't chirp! They tell you there are no teeth.
- Then let's go, write a receipt ...
Roman raised his eyebrows, rolled his eyes, bared his teeth and shook his head, but went out anyway. I looked around. There was little furniture in the room. By the window stood a massive table covered with shabby gray
fringed tablecloth, in front of the table - a rickety stool. Near the bare log wall there was a large sofa, on the other wall, covered with wallpaper of various sizes, there was a hanger with some kind of junk (quilted jackets, fur coats that came out, tattered caps and earflaps). A large Russian stove, shining with fresh whitewash, protruded into the room, and opposite in the corner hung a large dim mirror in a shabby
frame. The floor was scraped and covered with striped rugs.
Behind the wall they muttered in two voices: the old woman bassed on one note, Roman's voice rose and fell. “Tablecloth, inventory number two hundred and forty-five ...” - “You still write down every floorboard! ..” - “Dinner table ...” - “Will you also write down the oven? ..” - “Order is needed ... Sofa ...”
I went to the window and drew back the curtain. There was an oak tree outside the window, nothing else was visible. I
began to look at the oak. It was apparently a very ancient plant. The bark on it was gray and somehow
dead, and the monstrous roots that crawled out of the ground were covered with red and white lichen. "AND
write down another oak!” Roman said behind the wall. There was a plump greasy book on the windowsill, I
thoughtlessly leafed through it, moved away from the window and sat down on the sofa. And now I want to sleep. I thought,
that he had been driving for fourteen hours today, that he should not have been in such a hurry, that his back
it hurts me, but everything is confused in my head, that I don’t give a damn about this tedious old woman, and it would soon be over and I could lie down and fall asleep ...
- Well, - said Roman, appearing on the threshold. - The formalities are over. - He waved his hand.
with splayed fingers smeared with ink. - Our fingers are tired: we wrote, we wrote ... Go to bed. We leave, and you calmly go to bed. What are you doing tomorrow?
"I'm waiting," I answered languidly.
- Where?
- Here. And near the post office.
“You won’t leave tomorrow, will you?”
- Tomorrow is unlikely ... Most likely - the day after tomorrow.
"Then we'll see you again." Our love is ahead. He smiled, waved his hand and left. I
lazily thought that it would be necessary to see him off and say goodbye to Volodya, and lay down. Just then an old woman entered the room. I wake up. The old woman looked at me for some time.
“I’m afraid, father, that you’ll start to bark your teeth,” she said with concern.
“I won’t poke,” I said wearily. - I'm going to sleep.
- And lie down and sleep ... Just pay the money and sleep ...
I reached into my back pocket for my wallet.
- How much do I have to pay?
The old woman raised her eyes to the ceiling.
- We'll put a ruble for the room ... Fifty dollars for bed linen - it's mine, not state-owned. Behind
two nights it comes out three rubles...
I know…
I handed her a five.
“So far, a ruble from generosity,” I said. - And it will be seen there.
The old woman quickly grabbed the money and walked away, muttering something about change. She wasn't pretty
for a long time, and I already wanted to give up both change and linen, but she returned and laid a handful of dirty coppers on the table.
“Here’s your change, father,” she said. - Exactly a ruble, you can not count.
“I won’t count,” I said. - What about underwear?
- I'll make a bed now. You go out into the yard, take a walk, and I will make a bed.
I went out, pulling out cigarettes as I went. The sun finally set, and the white night came. Somewhere
dogs barked. I sat down under an oak tree on a bench that had grown into the ground, lit a cigarette and began to look at the pale, starless sky. A cat appeared noiselessly from somewhere, looked at me with fluorescent eyes, then quickly climbed up the oak tree and disappeared into the dark foliage. I immediately forgot about him and shuddered when he was brought somewhere upstairs. Debris fell on my head. "To you ..." - I said aloud and
began to shake off. I was extremely anxious to sleep. An old woman came out of the house, not noticing me, wandered to
well. I understood this to mean that the bed was ready, and returned to the room.
The bad old lady made a bed for me on the floor. Well, no, I thought, locked the door on the latch, dragged the bed onto the sofa and began to undress. A gloomy light fell from the window, a cat bustled noisily on the oak.
I shook my head, shaking the debris out of my hair. It was strange garbage, unexpected: large dry fish scales. It will be a good sleep, I thought, I fell on the pillow and immediately fell asleep.Chapter Two
... The empty house has turned into a den of foxes and badgers, and therefore strange
werewolves and ghosts.
A. UedaI woke up in the middle of the night because they were talking in the room. The two were talking, barely
audible whisper. The voices were very similar, but one was a little choked and hoarse, and
the other showed extreme irritation.
"Don't wheeze," he whispered, irritated. – Can you not wheeze?
“I can,” the strangled man replied and snorted.
“Be quiet…” he hissed, irritated.
“A hoarse one,” explained the strangled man. “Smoker's morning cough…” He suffocated again.
“Get out of here,” said the irritated one.
Yes, he's still sleeping...
- Who is he? Where did it fall from?
– How do I know?
- That's a shame ... Well, just phenomenally unlucky.
Again, the neighbors can not sleep, I thought awake. I imagined that I was at home. At home in my neighbors
two physicist brothers who love to work at night. By two in the morning they run out of cigarettes, and then they climb into my room and begin to fumble, banging furniture and arguing.
I grabbed a pillow and threw it into the void. Something crashed down with a noise, and it became quiet.
“Give back the pillow,” I said, “and get out. Cigarettes on the table.
The sound of my own voice woke me completely. I sat down. Dogs barked dejectedly, behind the wall
the old woman snored ominously. I finally remembered where I was. There was no one in the room. In the twilight light, I saw my pillow on the floor and the junk that had fallen from the hanger. Grandma will tear off her head
I thought and jumped up. The floor was cold and I stepped onto the rugs. Grandma stopped snoring. I
froze. The floorboards crackled, something crunched and rustled in the corners. Grandma whistled deafeningly
and snored again. I picked up the pillow and threw it on the sofa. The junk smelled of dog. The hanger fell off the nail and hung sideways. I corrected it and began to pick up junk. As soon as I hung the last
the cloak, like a hanger, broke off and, shuffling against the wallpaper, again hung on one nail. Grandma stopped
snoring, and I broke out in a cold sweat. Somewhere nearby, a rooster crowed. Into your soup, I thought with hatred. The old woman behind the wall began to spin, the springs creaked and clicked. I waited on one leg. In the courtyard, someone said quietly: "It's time to sleep, we've been sitting too long today." The voice was
young, feminine. “Sleep like that,” said another voice. A long yawn was heard. -
Won't you splash anymore today?" - "Something's cold. Come on guys." It became quiet. Grandma for-
snarled and grunted, and I cautiously returned to the sofa. I'll get up early in the morning and fix everything
should...
I lay down on my right side, pulled the blanket over my ear, closed my eyes and suddenly realized that I didn’t feel like sleeping at all - I wanted to eat. Ayyyyyyy, I thought. It was necessary to urgently take action, and I
accepted.
Here, let's say, is a system of two integral equations of the type of stellar statistics equations; both
unknown functions are under the integral. Of course, one can only solve numerically, say, at BESM... I remembered our BESM. Custard color control panel. Zhenya puts
on this panel a bundle of newspaper and unhurriedly unfolds it. "What do you have?" - "I have with cheese and
sausage." With Polish half-smoked, circles. “Hey, you need to get married! I have cutlets, with garlic, homemade. And pickles." No, two cucumbers ... Four cutlets and for good measure
four strong pickled cucumbers. And four slices of bread and butter...
I threw back the covers and sat up. Maybe there is something left in the car? No, everything that was there, I
ate. There was a cookbook for Valka's mother, who lives in Lezhnev. How is it there ... Sauce
pickan. Half a glass of vinegar, two onions ... and pepper. Served with meat dishes ... As I remember now: with small steaks. What a meanness, I thought, not just to steaks, but to small steaks. I jumped up and ran to the window. The night air smelled distinctly of little steaks. From somewhere in the depths of the subconscious surfaced: “He was served ordinary
dishes in restaurants, such as: sour cabbage soup, brains with peas, pickled cucumber (I took a sip) and the eternal puff sweet pie ... ”I would be distracted, I thought, and took the book from the windowsill. It was Alex
Tolstoy, Gloomy Morning. I opened at random. “Makhno, breaking the sardine key, pulled out of his pocket
mother-of-pearl knife with fifty blades and continued to wield it, opening tins of pineapples (bad business, I thought), French pate, with lobsters, from which there was a sharp smell around the room. I carefully put the book down and sat down at the table on a stool. Delicious food suddenly appeared in the room
pungent smell: it must have smelled like lobster. I began to wonder why I had never tasted lobster until now. Or, say, oysters. In Dickens's, everyone eats oysters, wields folding knives, cuts off thick slices of bread, spreads it with butter ... I began to nervously smooth the tablecloth. On the tablecloth
unwashed spots were visible. They ate a lot and deliciously. Ate lobsters and brains with peas. They ate small steaks with pican sauce. Large and medium steaks were also eaten. Satiated puffed
satisfactorily clicked their teeth ... I had nothing to take the rap from, and I began to click my teeth.
I must have done it loud and hungry, because the old woman behind the wall creaked the bed,
she muttered angrily, rattled something, and suddenly came into my room. She wore a long gray
shirt, and in her hands she carried a plate, and the real, and not fantastic, aroma of food immediately spread in the room. The old woman smiled. She set the plate right in front of me and sweetly boomed:
- Take a bite, father, Alexander Ivanovich. Eat what God sent, sent with me ...
“What are you, what are you, Naina Kievna,” I muttered, “why did you bother yourself so much ...
But in my hand I already had a fork with a bone handle from somewhere, and I began to eat, and the grandmother stood
nearby, nodding and saying:
- Eat, father, eat in good health ...
I ate everything. It was a hot potato with ghee.
“Naina Kievna,” I said earnestly, “you saved me from starvation.
- Have you eaten? said Naina Kievna somehow unfriendly.
- Ate great. Thank you very much! You cannot imagine...
“What can’t be imagined,” she interrupted, already completely irritated. Have you eaten, I say?
Well, give me a plate here ... A plate, I say, come on!
“For…please,” I said.
- "Please, please" ... Feed you here for please ...
“I can pay,” I said, getting angry.
- "Pay, pay" ... - She went to the door. What if they don't pay for it at all? And there's nothing
was lying...
- That is, how is it - to lie?
- And so lie! You said yourself that you won't tinkle…” She stopped talking and hid behind the door.
What is she? I thought. Some strange grandmother ... Maybe she noticed the hanger? Was
you can hear her creaking with springs, tossing and turning on the bed and grumbling with displeasure. Then she sang
softly to some barbaric motive: “I’ll ride, lie down, having eaten Ivashka’s meat ...” From
the windows were cold at night. I shivered, got up to return to the sofa, and then it dawned on me that I had locked the door before going to bed. Confused, I went to the door and stretched out my hand to check the latch, but as soon as my fingers touched the cold iron, everything swam before my eyes. It turned out that I was lying on the couch, with my nose buried in the pillow, and with my fingers I felt
cold log wall.
For some time I lay dying, until I realized that somewhere nearby an old woman was snoring, and they were talking in the room. Someone instructively spoke in an undertone:
- The elephant is the largest animal of all living on earth. He has a big one on his snout
a piece of meat called a trunk because it is empty and stretched out like a pipe. He stretches and bends it in all sorts of ways and uses it instead of a hand...
Cold with curiosity, I cautiously turned to my right side. The room was still empty. The voice continued even more instructively:
– Wine used in moderation is very good for the stomach; but when you drink too much of it, it produces vapors that degrade a person to the level of senseless beasts. Have you seen sometimes
drunkards and also remember that just disgust that you had for them ...
I jumped up and swung my legs off the couch. The voice is silent. It seemed to me that they were talking from somewhere behind the wall. Everything in the room was the same, even the hanger, to my surprise, hung on
place. And, to my surprise, I was very hungry again.
“Tincture ex vitro antimony,” a voice announced suddenly. I started. - Magiftherium Antimon Angelii Salae. Bafilia oleum vitry antimonia alexiterium antimoniale! - I heard
obvious giggle. - That's what nonsense! said the voice, and went on with a howl:
these eyes, still being opened, will no longer see the sun, but do not let it close without a sympathetic
notices of my forgiveness and bliss ... This is the "Spirit or Moral Thoughts of the Glorious Jung, extracted from his nightly reflections." Sold in St. Petersburg and Riga in bookstores
Sveshnikov's shops for two rubles in a folder. – Someone sobbed. "That's nonsense, too," said the voice, and
said with expression:
Ranks, beauty, wealth,
All the pleasures of this life
Flying, weakening, disappearing,
This is decay, and happiness is false!
Infections gnaw at the heart
And glory cannot be kept ...
Now I understand where they said. The voice came from a corner where a misty mirror hung.
“And now,” said the voice, “the next. “Everything is a single I, this I is the world I. Unity with ignorance, which comes from the eclipse of the light of I, disappears with the development of spirituality.”
- And where does this nonsense come from? I asked. I didn't expect an answer. I was sure that I was dreaming.
“Sayings from the Upanishads,” the voice answered readily.
What are the Upanishads? “I was no longer sure I was dreaming.
“I don't know,” the voice said.
I got up and tiptoed over to the mirror. I didn't see my reflection. The cloudy glass reflected the curtain, the corner of the stove, and many things in general. But I wasn't in it.
- What's the matter? the voice asked. - Have questions?
- Who is speaking? I asked looking behind the mirror. Behind the mirror there was a lot of dust and dead
spiders. Then I pressed my left eye with my index finger. It was an old rule for recognizing hallucinations, which I read in the fascinating book by V. V. Bitner "To believe or not to believe?". It is enough to press a finger on the eyeball, and all real objects - unlike
hallucinations - bifurcate. The mirror split in two, and my reflection appeared in it - sleepy,
anxious face. It blew down my legs. Cursing my fingers, I went to the window and looked out.
There was no one outside the window, not even an oak tree. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. I distinctly
I saw right in front of me a mossy well log house with a gate, a gate and my car at the gate. I'm still asleep, I thought calmly. My gaze fell on the windowsill, on the disheveled book. In pro-
in my last dream it was the third volume of the Pain, now on the cover I read: “P. I. Karpov.
Creativity of the mentally ill and its influence on the development of science, art and technology. Teeth chattering from the chill, I leafed through the book and looked through the colored inserts. Then I read "Verse #2":
In the circle of clouds high
black-winged sparrow
Trembling and lonely
Soars quickly above the ground.
He flies at night
Illuminated by moonlight,
And, dismayed by nothing,
He sees everything below him.
Proud, predatory, furious
And flying like a shadow
Eyes glow like day.
The floor suddenly swayed under my feet. There was a piercing lingering creak, then, like the rumble of a distant earthquake, there was a roaring: “Ko-o… Ko-o… Ko-o…” The hut shook like a boat on the waves. The yard outside the window moved to the side, and from under the window climbed out and stuck
claws into the ground, a gigantic chicken leg, made deep furrows in the grass and disappeared again. Floor
lurched steeply, I felt that I was falling, grabbed something soft with my hands, hit my side and
head and fell off the couch. I was lying on the rugs, clutching the pillow that had fallen along with
me. The room was completely light. Outside the window, someone was clearing his throat.
“Well, well…” said a well-trained male voice. - In some there was a kingdom, in some state there lived a king, by name ... me-eh ... well, in the end, it doesn’t matter. Let's say, mne... Poluekt... He had three sons, princes. The first one… me-uh… The third one was a fool, but the first one?..
Bending down like a soldier under fire, I crept up to the window and looked out. The oak was there.
With his back to him, the cat Vasily stood on his hind legs in deep thought. He had a water lily in his teeth. The cat looked at his feet and pulled: "Mne-uh ..." Then he shook his head,
he put his front paws behind his back and, stooping slightly, like assistant professor Dubino-Knyazhitsky at a lecture, walked with a smooth step away from the oak.
“Okay…” the cat said through clenched teeth. - There was a king and a queen. The king, the queen had
one son… Mne-eh… Fool, of course…
The cat spat out the flower in annoyance and rubbed his forehead, grimacing all over.
“A desperate situation,” he said. - I do remember something! “Ha ha ha! There will be something to eat: a horse for lunch, well done for dinner ... ”Where would it come from? And Ivan, you yourself understand - a fool, replies: "Oh, you filthy monster, not catching a white swan, but eat!" Then, of course - red-hot
an arrow, all three heads off, Ivan takes out three hearts and brings, cretin, home to his mother ... What
present! The cat laughed sardonically, then sighed. - There is another disease - sclerosis - he said.
He sighed again, turned back to the oak and sang: “Quack, quack, my little children! Quack, quack, pigeons! I… mne-uh… I soldered you with a tear… or rather, soldered you…” He sighed for the third time and walked in silence for a while. Coming up with the oak, he suddenly yelled unmusically: “Sweet bite is not
finished eating!.. "
He suddenly had a massive harp in his paws - I didn’t even notice where he got them. He desperately hit them with his paw and, clinging to the strings with his claws, yelled even louder, as if trying to drown out the music:
Dass im tannwald finster east,
Das macht das holts,
Das… meh… mein shatz… or katz?..
He fell silent and walked for some time, silently tapping on the strings. Then, softly, hesitantly, he sang:
Oh, I'm in the same garden,
I'll tell you the whole truth:
Oto so
Dig poppy.
He returned to the oak, leaned his harp against it, and scratched behind his ear with his back foot.
“Work, work, work,” he said. - Only work!
He put his paws behind his back again and walked to the left of the oak, muttering:
- It came to me, O great king, that in the glorious city of Baghdad there lived a tailor, named ...
He got on all fours, arched his back, and hissed angrily. - With these names I have especially
disgusting! Abu... Ali... Someone ibn someone... W-well, let's say Poluekt. Poluekt ibn…
me-uh… Poluektovich… I still don’t remember what happened to this tailor. Well, the dog is with him, let's start another ...
I lay on my stomach on the windowsill and, sighing, watched the unfortunate Vasily wander around the oak, now to the right, then to the left, muttering, clearing his throat, howling, mooing, becoming tense on
on all fours - in a word, it suffers unspeakably. The range of his knowledge was enormous. Not a single fairy tale
he did not know a single song more than half, but they were Russian, Ukrainian, West Slavic, German, English, in my opinion, even Japanese, Chinese and African fairy tales, legends, parables, ballads, songs, romances, ditties and refrains. Sclerosis made him furious,
several times he threw himself on the trunk of an oak and tore the bark with his claws, he hissed and spat, and his eyes
they burned like those of the devil, and the fluffy tail, thick as a log, now looked at the zenith, then convulsively
twitched, then whipped him on the sides. But the only song he sang to the end was
"Chizhik-Pyzhik", and the only fairy tale that he coherently told was "The House That Jack Built" in Marshak's translation, and even then with some cuts. Gradually - apparently from fatigue - his speech acquired an increasingly distinct cat accent. “And in poly, poly,” he sang, “himself
plow plow, a ... mne-e ... a ... mne-a-a-u! .. and behind that plow he himself ... mya-a-u-a-u!
Or Brode?.. ”In the end, he was completely exhausted, sat on his tail and sat there for a while, hanging his head. Then he meowed softly, sadly, took the harp under his arm and slowly hobbled along the dewy grass on three legs.
I climbed off the windowsill and dropped the book. I distinctly remember that the last time it was
"Creativity of the mentally ill", I was sure that this book fell on the floor. But I picked
put on the windowsill "Crimes Disclosure" by A. Swenson and O. Wendel. I stupidly opened it
I ran through several paragraphs at random, and at once it seemed to me that a strangled man was hanging on an oak tree. I
he raised his eyes apprehensively. A wet, silver-green shark's tail hung from the bottom branch of an oak tree.
The tail swayed heavily in the morning breeze.
I shied away and hit the back of my head on something hard. The telephone rang loudly. I looked around. I was lying
across the sofa, the blanket slipped from me to the floor, the morning sun beat through the window through the leaves of the oak.Chapter Three
It occurred to me that the usual interview with the devil or wizard could be successfully replaced
skillful use of the provisions of science.
H. J. WellsPhone rang. I rubbed my eyes, looked out the window (the oak was in place), looked at the hanger
(the hanger was also in place). Phone rang. Behind the wall, the old woman's room was quiet. Then I jumped to the floor, opened the door (the latch was in place) and went out into the hallway. Phone rang. He
stood on a shelf above a large tub - a very modern apparatus of white plastic, such
seen only in the cinema and in the office of our director. I picked up the phone.
- Hello...
- Who is this? asked a piercing female voice.
- And who do you need?
“Is that Iznakurnizh?”
- What?
- I say, is this a hut on kurnog or not? Who is speaking?
“Yes,” I said. - Hut. Who do you need?
"Oh hell," said a female voice. - Take the phone call.
- Let's.
- Write it down.
“One minute,” I said. I'll take a pencil and paper.
"Oh hell," said a female voice.
I brought a notebook and a collet pencil.
- I'm hearing you.
"Telephone number two hundred and six," said a woman's voice. - Citizen Gorynych Naina
Kiev…
- Not so fast ... Kiev ... Further?
“You are hereby… invited to… arrive today… the twenty-seventh of July… this year…
at midnight ... for the annual republican rally ... "Recorded?
- Recorded.
- “The first meeting ... will take place ... on Bald Mountain. Dress uniform. Use of mechanical transport ... at your own expense. Signature… head of the office… Ha… Um… Viy.”
- Who?
- Viy! Ha Em Wii.
- I don't understand.
- Viy! Hron Monadovich! What, you don't know the head of the office?
“I don't know,” I said. - Spell it out.
- Devilishness! Okay, spell it out: Werewolf - Incubus - Ibicus short ... Did you write it down?
“I think I wrote it down,” I said. - It turned out - Viy.
- Who?
- Viy!
- Do you have polyps? I don't understand!
- Vladimir! Ivan! Ivan short!
- So. Repeat phone call.
I repeated.
- Right. Passed Onuchkin. Who accepted?
- Privalov.
- Greetings, Privalov! How long have you been serving?
“Dogs serve,” I said angrily. - I am working.
- Well, well, work. We'll meet at the retreat.
There were horns. I hung up the phone and returned to the room. The morning was cool, I hastily
did the exercises and got dressed. What was happening seemed to me extremely curious. telephone message
strangely associated in my mind with night events, although I had no idea,
how. However, some ideas had already occurred to me, and my imagination was excited.
Everything that I happened to be a witness here was not completely unfamiliar to me, I read something about such cases somewhere and now I remembered that the behavior of people who fell into similar circumstances always seemed to me extraordinarily, irritatingly absurd. Instead of,
in order to make full use of the fascinating prospects opened up for them by a happy accident, they were frightened, tried to return to the ordinary. Some hero even conjured readers to stay away from the veil that separates our world from the unknown, frightening with spiritual and physical
injuries. I did not yet know how events would unfold, but I was already ready to plunge into them with enthusiasm.
Wandering around the room in search of a ladle or mug, I continued to reason. These shy people
I thought, like some experimental scientists, very hard working, very hardworking, but
completely unimaginative and therefore very cautious. Having obtained a non-trivial result,
they shy away from it, hurriedly explain it as the impurity of the experiment, and in fact walk away from it.
new, because they got too used to the old, comfortably laid within the limits of authoritative theory ... I was already considering some experiments with a flip book (it was still lying
on the windowsill and was now Aldridge's "Last Exile") with a talking mirror and a chirp. I had a few questions for the cat Vasily, and the mermaid living on the oak was of some interest, although at times it seemed to me that I did dream about her. I
I have nothing against mermaids, but I can’t imagine how they can climb trees ... although, with
the other side, scales?..
I found a ladle on a tub under the telephone, but there was no water in the tub, and I went to
well. The sun has already risen quite high. Cars were honking somewhere, a policeman was heard
a whistle, a helicopter swam in the sky with a solid rumble. I went to the well and, with satisfaction, having found a crumpled tin pail on a chain, began to unwind the gate. The tub, tapping on the walls, went
into the black depth. There was a splash, the chain stretched. I turned the gate and looked at my Moskvich. At
the car had a tired, dusty look, the windshield was smeared with midges that had smashed to smithereens on it. It will be necessary to add water to the radiator, I thought. And generally speaking…
The tub seemed very heavy to me. When I put it on the log house, a huge pike head popped out of the water, green and all kind of mossy. I jumped back.
- Will you drag me to the market again? - very okaya, said the pike. I was dumbfounded silent. - Give me
you give me peace, insatiable! How much can I? .. I’ll calm down a little, I’ll try to rest and take a nap
tashshit! I’m not young anymore, I’ll be older than you ... my gills are also not in order ...
It was very strange to watch her speak. Just like a pike in a puppet theater, she
with might and main opened and closed her toothy mouth in an unpleasant discrepancy with the uttered sounds. She uttered the last phrase with a convulsive clenching of her jaw.
“And the air is bad for me,” she continued. "I'm going to die, what are you going to do?" Everything is stinginess
yours, woman and foolishness ... You save everything, but for what you save - you don’t know yourself ... On the last reform, that
how did you get burned? That's it! And Catherine's? Pasted the chests! And kerenki-ta, kerenki! After all
stoked the stove with kerenki ...
“You see,” I said, recovering a little.
– Oh, who is it? - scared pike.
“I… I'm here by chance… I intended to wash a little.
- Wash up! And I thought - again the old woman. I don't see it, it's old. Yes, and the refractive index in
air, they say, quite different. I ordered air glasses for myself, but I lost it, I can’t find it ... And who
will you?
“Tourist,” I said curtly.
- Ah, a tourist ... And I thought - again a grandmother. What is she doing to me! Catch me, drag me
to the market and sells there, supposedly in the ear. Well, what is left for me? Of course, you say to the buyer: so
so, let me go to the little kids - although what kind of little kids I have there - not the kids who are already alive, but grandfathers. You will let me go, and I will serve you, just say "at the command of the pike,
according to my wish." Well, they let go. Some out of fear, others out of kindness, and some out of greed ... You swim in the river, you swim - it’s cold, rheumatism, you climb back into the well, and
the old woman with the tub is right there again ... - The pike hid in the water, gurgled and leaned out again. - Well
what are you going to ask, soldier? Only something simpler, otherwise they ask for some kind of TVs, transistors ... One was completely stunned: “Fulfill, he says, for me the annual plan at the sawmill.” My years are not
those - sawing firewood ...
“Yeah,” I said. - And you, then, still can TV?
“No,” the pike honestly admitted. I can't TV. And this ... combine with a player can’t either. I don't believe in them. You are something faster. Boots, let's say, runners or a cap of invisibility ... Huh?
The hope that arose in me to get away today from the Moskvich grease went out.
“Don't worry,” I said. - I don't need anything. I will let you go now.
“Good,” the pike said calmly. – I love such people. Just now, too ... Bought me for
some kind of market, I promised him the royal daughter. I'm floating on the river, I'm ashamed, of course, I have nowhere to put my eyes. Well, I went blind and entered the net. Tashshat. Again, I think I'll have to lie. And what does he do? He got me
enough across the teeth, so that the mouth does not open. Well, I think it's over, they'll cook it. An no. He pinches me
something fin and throws back into the river. In! - The pike leaned out of the tub and put out its fin,
grasped at the base with a metal clip. On the clip I read: "Launched this instance in
Nightingale River 1854. Deliver to E.I.V. Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg. “Don’t tell the old woman,” the pike warned. - It will tear off with a fin. She is greedy, mean.
"What should I ask her?" I thought frantically.
How do you do your miracles?
– What are these miracles?
- Well ... the fulfillment of desires ...
- Oh, is this? How I do it… Trained from childhood, so I do it. How do I know how I do it ... Goldfish did it even better, but all the same died. You can't escape fate.
It seemed to me that the pike sighed.
- From old age? I asked.
– What there from old age! She was young, strong ... They threw a depth bomb at her, a serviceman. And they let her belly up, and some kind of underwater ship happened nearby, also sank. She
I would have paid off, but they didn’t ask her, they saw her and immediately with a bomb ... That's how it happens. - She
paused. "So are you letting me go or what?" Something stuffy, there will be a thunderstorm ...
“Of course, of course,” I said, startled. - How about you - to leave or in a tub? ..
- Drop it, soldier, drop it.
I carefully put my hands into the tub and took out the pike - there were eight kilograms in it. Pike
muttered: “Well, if there is a self-assembled tablecloth or, say, a flying carpet, then I will be here ... For
I won’t be lost…” “Goodbye,” I said and unclenched my hands. There was a noisy splash.
For some time I stood looking at my palms, stained with greenery. I had some
strange feeling. From time to time, like a gust of wind, the consciousness came that I was sitting in the room on the sofa, but as soon as I shook my head, I again found myself at the well. Then it passed. I washed my face with excellent ice water, filled the radiator and shaved. The old woman did not show up. I wanted to eat, and I need to
I had to go to the city to the post office, where the guys were already waiting for me. I locked the car and got out
gates.
I walked leisurely along Lukomorye Street, thrusting my hands into the pockets of my gray GDR jacket.
and looking down at your feet. In the back pocket of my favorite jeans, streaked with "lightning", the old woman's coppers jingled. I was wondering. The skinny pamphlets of the Knowledge Society taught me to think that animals are not capable of talking. Fairy tales from childhood convinced me otherwise. I agree
I was, of course, with pamphlets, because I had never seen talking animals in my life. Even parrots. I used to know a parrot that could roar like a tiger, but he couldn't do it like a human. And so
now - a pike, a cat Vasily and even a mirror. However, inanimate objects just talk often. And, by the way, this consideration would never have occurred to, say, my great-grandfather. From his great-grandfather's point of view, a talking cat is a far less fantastic thing than a polished wooden box that wheezes, howls, plays music and speaks many languages. With a cat
is also more or less clear. But how does a pike talk? Pike don't have lungs. It's right. True, at
it should be a swim bladder, the function of which, as I know, is not yet completely clear to ichthyologists. My acquaintance ichthyologist Zhenya Skoromakhov even believes that this function is completely unclear, and when I try to argue with arguments from the brochures of the Knowledge Society, Zhenya
growls and spits. It completely loses its inherent gift of human speech ... I have the impression that we still know very little about the capabilities of animals. Only recently it became clear
that fish and marine animals exchange signals underwater. Very interesting write about dolphins. Or, say, the monkey Raphael. I saw it myself. It is true that she does not know how to talk, but
she developed a reflex: green light - banana, red light - electric shock. And everything was fine until they turned on the red and green lights at the same time. Then Raphael behaved
just like Zhenya, for example. He was terribly offended. He rushed to the window where the experimenter was sitting, and began, screeching and growling, spitting into this window. And in general there is an anecdote - one
the monkey says to the other, “Do you know what a conditioned reflex is? That's when the bell rings and all those
quasi-monkeys in white coats will run to us with bananas and sweets.” Of course, all this is extremely difficult. The terminology has not been developed. When in these conditions you try to solve problems,
associated with the psyche and potentialities of animals, you feel completely
powerless. But, on the other hand, when you are given, say, the same system of integral equations
like stellar statistics with unknown functions under the integral, then the state of health is not better. A
so the main thing is to think. Like Pascal: “Let us learn to think well - this is the basic principle
morality."
I went out to Mira Avenue and stopped, attracted by an unusual sight. On the pavement
there was a man with children's flags in his hands. Behind him, ten paces away, with a strained roar, slowly crawled
a large white MAZ with a giant smoking trailer in the form of a silver tank. The word “flammable” was written on the tank, to the right and left of it, red fire engines, bristling with fire extinguishers, rolled just as slowly. From time to time, the smooth roar of the engine intervened
some new sound that unpleasantly chilled the heart, and then yellow
tongues of flame. The faces of the firefighters under their hooded helmets were courageous and stern. Around
the cavalcades rushed about in a cloud of children. They shrieked piercingly: “Tilili-tilili, and the dragon was taken!” Adult passers-by cautiously pressed against the fences. A clear desire was written on their faces to protect their clothes from possible damage.“They’ve brought a dear one,” said a familiar creaky bass over my ear.
I turned around. Behind stood Naina Kievna, dismayed, with a purse filled with blue
bags of sugar.
“Go ahead,” she repeated. - Every Friday they carry ...
- Where? I asked.
- To the landfill, father. Everyone is experimenting... There is nothing else for them to do.
- And who was taken, Naina Kievna?
- That is, how is it - whom? You don't see it yourself, do you?
She turned and walked away, but I caught up with her.
- Naina Kievna, you have received a telephone message here.
- Who is it from?
“From Ha Em Wii.
– And about what?
“You have some kind of meeting today,” I said, looking at her intently. - On Bald Mountain. Form
clothes - front.
The old woman was clearly delighted.
– Really? - she said. - That's good, then! .. And where is the telephone message?
- In the hallway on the phone.
Does it say anything about membership dues? she asked, lowering her voice.
- In what sense?
- Well, what, they say, it is necessary to pay off the debt with one thousand seven hundred ... - She fell silent.
“No,” I said. - Nothing like that was said.
- Well, good. And what about transport? Will they deliver a car or what?
“Let me bring you a purse,” I suggested.
The old woman recoiled.
- Why are you doing this? she asked suspiciously. - You leave it - I don’t like ... His wallet! ..
Young, yes, apparently, from the early ones ...
I don't like old women, I thought.
So what about transportation? she repeated.
“At my own expense,” I said gloomily.
- Ah, hoarders! groaned the old woman. - The broom was taken to the museum, the stupa is not being repaired, contributions
they tear up five rubles for banknotes, and to Lysaya Gora at their own expense! The account is not small, father, yes
while the taxi is waiting...
Muttering and coughing, she turned away from me and walked away. I rubbed my hands and also went mine
Expensive. My assumptions were justified. The knot of astonishing events tightened ever tighter. And I'm ashamed to admit it, but it seemed to me now more interesting than even modeling
reflex arc.
Prospekt Mira was already empty. At the crossroads, a flock of children was spinning - they were playing, in my opinion, siskin. When they saw me, they abandoned the game and began to approach. Anticipating something bad, I hurriedly passed them and moved towards the center. Behind me there was a strangled enthusiastic exclamation: "Dandy!" I quickened my pace. "Dandy!" several voices yelled at once. I almost ran.
Behind them squealed: “Style-yeah! Thin-legged! Papa’s “Victory”!..” Passers-by looked at me sympathetically. In such situations, it is best to dive somewhere. I dived into the nearest store, which turned out to be a grocery store, walked along the counters, made sure that there was sugar, a selection of sausages and
sweets is not rich, but the choice of so-called fish products exceeds all expectations. There was such salmon and such salmon! .. I drank a glass of sparkling water and looked out into the street. Boys
did not have. Then I left the store and moved on. Soon sheds and log huts-redoubts
ran out, went modern two-story houses with open gardens. Babies were scurrying about in the squares, elderly women were knitting something warm, and elderly men were playing dominoes.
In the center of the city was a vast square, surrounded by two - and three-story buildings.
The area was paved, in the middle there was a green garden. Above the greenery rose a large red shield with the inscription "Honor Board" and several smaller shields with diagrams and diagrams. I found the post office here, on the square. We agreed with the guys that the first one to arrive at
city, will leave a note on demand with their coordinates. There was no note and I left
a letter in which he gave his address and explained how to get to the hut on curnogi. Then I decided
have breakfast.
Walking around the square, I found: a cinema where "Kozara" was on; bookstore closed for
rediscount; City Council, in front of which stood several thoroughly dusted "gaziks"; the hotel "Cold Sea" - as usual, without vacancies; two kiosks with soda water and ice cream; shop (manufactured goods) No. 2 and shop (household goods) No. 18; canteen №11, opening from
twelve o'clock, and buffet number 3, closed without explanation. Then I found the city branch
police, near the open doors of which I talked with a very young policeman with the rank of sergeant, who explained to me where the gas station was and what the road to Lezhnev was. "Where is your car?" the policeman inquired, looking around the square. “From acquaintances,” I replied. "Oh, my friends..."
- said the policeman significantly. I think he took note of me. I bowed timidly.
Next to the three-story building of Solrybsnabprompotrebsoyuz FCU, I finally found a small tidy tea house No. 16/27. The tearoom was good. There were not very many people, they really drank tea and talked about understandable things: that, finally, a bridge had collapsed under Korobets and
now you have to wade; that the traffic police post had already been removed from the fifteenth kilometer for a week; What
“a spark is a beast, it will kill an elephant, but it doesn’t catch a shish ...” There was a smell of gasoline and fried fish. Not busy
people who were talking were staring at my jeans, and I was glad that I had
the place is a professional stain - the day before yesterday I very successfully sat down on a syringe with grease.
I took a full plate of fried fish, three glasses of tea and three sandwiches with balyk, paid off with a bunch of old woman's coppers ("I was standing on the porch ..." - the barmaid grumbled), settled in
secluded corner and began to eat, with pleasure watching these hoarse-voiced, smoky people. It was nice to see how tanned, independent, wiry they were, who had seen everything, how they eat with appetite, smoke with appetite, talk with appetite. They used the respite to the last drop before long hours of shaking boring road, hot stuffiness
cabins, dust and sun. If I hadn’t been a programmer, I would definitely have become a driver and I would have worked not on a shabby car, and not even on a bus, but on some kind of cargo monster, so that I had to climb a ladder into the cab, and change the wheel with the help of small crane.
At the next table sat two young men who did not look like chauffeurs, and therefore at first I did not pay attention to them. The same, however, as they did to me. But when I was finishing my second glass of tea, the word “sofa” flew up to me. Then one of them said: “... And then it is not clear why it exists at all, this Iznakurnizh ...” - and I began to listen. Unfortunately they said
quietly, and I was sitting with my back to them, so it was hard to hear. But the voices seemed familiar to me: "... no theses ... only a sofa ...", "... so hairy? ..", "... a sofa ... the sixteenth
degree…”, “…with transgression only fourteen orders…”, “…it is easier to model the translator…”, “…you never know who giggles!..”, “…I’ll give you a razor…”, “…we can’t live without a sofa…”. Here alone
of them suffocated, so familiar that I immediately remembered tonight and turned around, but they were already
walked to the exit - two hefty guys with steep shoulders and athletic nape. Some
while I still saw them through the window, they crossed the square, went around the garden and disappeared behind the diagrams. I
I finished my tea, finished my sandwiches and went out too. Their sofa, you see, worries me, I thought. Mermaid don't have them
worries. The talking cat does not interest them. And without a sofa, you see, they cannot ... I tried
remember what kind of sofa I have there, but I couldn’t remember anything special. A sofa is like a sofa.
Good sofa. Comfortable. Only a strange reality is dreaming on him.
Now it would be nice to go home and take care of all these couch affairs closely.
Experiment with a flip book, talk frankly with the cat Vasily and see if there is anything else interesting in the hut on chicken legs. But at home, my Moskvich was waiting for me and the need to do both EU and MOT. It was still possible to reconcile with EU, this is just Daily Care, all sorts of shaking out rugs and washing the body with a jet of water under pressure, which washing, however, can be replaced if necessary by watering from a garden watering can or bucket. But here is THAT… On a hot day, a clean person is afraid to think about THAT. Because TO
is nothing but Maintenance, and maintenance is what I
I lie under the car with an oil syringe in my hands and gradually transfer the contents of the syringe
both in cap oilers, and on his physiognomy. It is hot and stuffy under the car, and the bottom
it, covered with a thick layer of dried mud ... In short, I did not really want to go home.Chapter Four
Who allowed himself this devilish joke? Grab him and unmask him so we know
whom shall we hang on the fortress wall in the morning!
E. A. PoI bought the day before yesterday's Pravda, drank sparkling water and sat down on a bench in the garden,
in the shadow of the Hall of Fame. It was eleven o'clock. I carefully looked through the newspaper. It took seven
minutes. Then I read an article about hydroponics, a feuilleton about thieves from Kansk, and a long letter from the workers of a chemical plant to the editor. It only took twenty-two minutes. Shouldn't you go
to the movies, I thought. But I have already seen Kozara - once in the cinema and once on TV. Then I decided to have a drink of water, folded the newspaper and got up. Of all the old woman's copper in my pocket, I only have
one nickel. Drink up, I decided, drank water with syrup, got a penny of change and bought it in a nearby
a stall of boxes of matches. There was absolutely nothing else for me to do in the city center. And I went where
eyes look - into a narrow street between store No. 2 and dining room No. 11.
There were almost no passers-by on the street. I was overtaken by a large dusty truck with a rumbling
trailer. The driver, poking his elbow and head out the window, looked wearily at the cobblestone pavement. Street,
descending, it turned sharply to the right, at the turn next to the pavement the barrel of an old cast-iron cannon stuck out of the ground, its muzzle was clogged with earth and cigarette butts. Soon the street ended in a cliff
river. I sat on the edge of the cliff and admired the scenery, then crossed to the other side and wandered back.
I wonder where that truck went? I suddenly thought. There was no drop off. I began to look around, looking for the gate on the sides of the street, and then I found a small, but very strange house,
squeezed between two gloomy brick sheds. The windows of the lower floor of his were taken away
iron rods and half covered with chalk. There were no doors in the house at all. I noticed
this is immediately because the sign, which is usually placed next to the gate or next to the entrance,
hung right here between two windows. The sign read: "AN USSR NIICHAVO". I
went to the middle of the street: yes, two floors with ten windows and not a single door. And on the right and left, close, storehouses. NICHAVO, I thought. Research Institute… FAQ? I mean what?
Extremely Automated Armed Guards? Black Associations of Eastern Oceania?
The hut on kurnogs, I thought, is a museum of this very NIICHAVO. My fellow travelers are probably from here too. And those in the tearoom, too... A flock of crows rose from the roof of the building
street. I turned and walked back to the square.
We are all naive materialists, I thought. And we are all rationalists. We want everything to be
immediately explained rationalistically, that is, reduced to a handful of already known facts. And neither
none of us has a penny of dialectics. It never occurs to anyone that between the known facts
and some new phenomenon may lie the sea of ​​the unknown, and then we declare a new phenomenon
supernatural and therefore impossible. For example, how would the master Montesquieu take
message about reviving a dead person forty-five minutes after the recorded stop
hearts? I would probably take it with hostility. So to speak, in baguettes. I would call it obscurantism and
priesthood. If only he hadn't dismissed such a message at all. And if that happened to him
his eyes, he would be in an unusually difficult position. As I am now, only I'm more used to it. And he would either have to consider this resurrection a scam, or renounce his own
sensations, or even renounce materialism. Most likely, he would consider the resurrection a scam. But for the rest of his life, the memory of this clever trick would have irritated his thought, like
mote in the eye ... But we are children of another century. We have seen everything: a live dog's head sewn to the back of another live dog; and an artificial kidney the size of a closet; and dead iron
a hand controlled by living nerves; and people who may casually remark: “It was already
after I died for the first time ... "Yes, in our time, Montesquieu would not have many chances
stay materialistic. And here we are, and nothing! True, sometimes it is difficult - when a random wind suddenly brings to us across the ocean of the unknown strange petals from the boundless continents of the unknown. And this happens especially often when you find something that you are not looking for. Soon amazing animals will appear in zoological museums, the first animals from Mars or Venus. Yes,
of course, we will stare at them and slap our thighs, but we have been waiting for these animals for a long time, we are well prepared for their appearance. We would be much more amazed and disappointed if these animals did not appear or if they turned out to be similar to our cats and dogs.
As a rule, the science in which we believe (and often blindly) prepares us in advance and for a long time for future miracles, and we only get psychological shock when we are faced with the unpredictable - some kind of hole in the fourth dimension, or biological radio communication, or a living planet ... Or, say, a hut on chicken legs ... But hook-nosed Roman was right: here they have
very, very, very interesting...
I went out into the square and stopped in front of a soda kiosk. I remembered exactly what
I don’t have change, and I knew that I would have to exchange a piece of paper, and I was already preparing an ingratiating smile,
because soda vendors hate to change paper money, when all of a sudden
I found a nickel in my jeans pocket. I was surprised and delighted, but overjoyed. I drank
sparkling water with syrup, received a wet change and talked to the saleswoman about the weather.
Then I resolutely headed home in order to quickly finish with the EU and TO and engage in rational dialectical explanations. I put the kopeck in my pocket and stopped, discovering that in the same
there is one more penny in the pocket. I took it out and examined it. The nickel was slightly damp, it had
"5 kopecks 1961" was written, and the number "6" was hushed up with a shallow dent. Maybe I even
then I would not have paid attention to this small incident, if not for that very instant
a feeling already familiar to me - as if I was simultaneously standing on Prospekt Mira and sitting on the couch,
stupidly looking at the hanger. And just like before, when I shook my head, the feeling disappeared.
For some time I walked slowly, absently tossing and catching a nickel (it fell on the palm of my hand).
all the time "tails"), and tried to concentrate. Then I saw the grocery store where I had escaped from the boys in the morning, and I went in there. Holding the nickel between two fingers, I went straight to the counter, where
sold juices and water, and without any pleasure drank a glass without syrup. Then, holding the change in
fist, I stepped aside and checked the pocket.
It was the very case when psychological shock does not occur. I'd rather be surprised
if there was no nickel in the pocket. But he was there - wet, 1961, with a chipped
number "6". I was pushed and asked if I was awake. Turns out I was standing in line at the checkout. I
said I was awake and knocked out a check for three boxes of matches. Standing in line for matches, I found
that the nickel is in the pocket. I was completely calm. After receiving three boxes, I left the store, returned to the square and began to experiment.
The experiment took me about an hour. During this hour I walked around the square ten times, swollen
from water, matchboxes and newspapers, got acquainted with all the sellers and saleswomen and came to a number of interesting conclusions. The nickel comes back if they get paid. If you just throw it, drop it, lose it, it will remain where it fell. The penny is returned to the pocket at the moment when the change
passes from the hands of the seller to the hands of the buyer. If at the same time keep your hand in one pocket, a nickel
appears in another. In a pocket fastened with a zipper, it never appears. If you keep
hands in both pockets and accept change with your elbow, then a nickel can appear anywhere on the body (in
in my case, it was found in a shoe). The disappearance of a nickel from a plate with copper on the counter cannot be noticed: among other copper, the nickel is immediately lost, and there is no movement in the plate in
there is no moment when the penny goes into the pocket.
So, we were dealing with the so-called fiat penny in the process of its functioning. By itself, the fact of immutability did not interest me very much. My imagination was first of all shocked by the possibility of extra-spatial movement of a material body. I was
it is quite clear that the mysterious transfer of a nickel from the seller to the buyer is not
nothing more than a special case of the notorious null-transportation, well-known to science fiction fans also under pseudonyms: hypertransition, regular jump, Tarantoga phenomenon… The opening prospects were dazzling.
I didn't have any appliances. An ordinary laboratory minimum thermometer could
I would give a lot, but I didn't even have it. I was forced to limit myself to purely visual subjective observations. I began my last circle around the square by placing in front of me
the following task: “Putting a nickel next to a plate for change and, if possible, preventing
the seller to mix it with the rest of the money before handing over the change, visually trace the process of moving a nickel in space, while at the same time trying to at least qualitatively determine the change in air temperature near the proposed transition trajectory. However, the experiment was
interrupted at the beginning.
When I approached the saleswoman Manya, the same young policeman was already waiting for me in
rank of sergeant.
“Yes,” he said in a professional voice.
I looked at him searchingly, foreboding something bad.
“I’ll ask for documents, citizen,” said the policeman, saluting and looking past me.
- What's the matter? I asked, taking out my passport.
“And I’ll ask for a nickel,” said the policeman, accepting the passport.
I silently gave him a penny. Mania looked at me with angry eyes. The policeman looked at the nickel and, uttering with satisfaction: "Aha ...", opened the passport. He studied the passport like a bibliophile
studies a rare incunabula. I patiently waited. The crowd slowly grew around. The crowd expressed different opinions about me.
“We’ll have to go through,” the policeman said at last.
We passed. While we were passing, several options were created in the crowd of escorts
my difficult biography, and a number of reasons were formulated that caused the beginning of
eyes of consequence.
In the department, the sergeant handed over a nickel and a passport to the lieutenant on duty. He examined the penny and
invited me to sit down. I sat down. The lieutenant casually said: "Hand over the change," and also delved into
study of the passport. I took the coppers out of my pocket. “Recalculate, Kovalyov,” the lieutenant said and, putting down his passport, began to look into my eyes.
- Did you buy a lot? - he asked.
“A lot,” I replied.
"Give it up too," said the lieutenant.
I laid out on the table in front of him four issues of the day before yesterday's Pravda, three issues of the local newspaper Rybak, two issues of the Literaturnaya Gazeta, eight boxes of matches, six pieces of Golden Key toffee, and a discounted brush for cleaning the stove.
“I can’t hand over the water,” I said dryly. “Five glasses with syrup and four without syrup.
I began to understand what was the matter, and I was extremely embarrassed and dreary at the thought that
will have to justify.
“Seventy-four kopecks, Comrade Lieutenant,” young Kovalev reported.
The lieutenant contemplated thoughtfully a pile of newspapers and matchboxes.
Did you have fun or what? he asked me.
“Or something,” I said grimly.
"Not careful," said the lieutenant. “Not careful, citizen. Tell me.
I told. At the end of the story, I convincingly asked the lieutenant not to consider my actions as an attempt to save money for the Zaporozhets. My ears were on fire. The lieutenant chuckled.
- Why not consider it? he inquired. - There were cases when they accumulated.
I shrugged.
- I assure you, such a thought could not have occurred to me ... That is, what I say - could not
She really didn't come!
The lieutenant was silent for a long time. Young Kovalev took my passport and began to examine it again.
“It’s even somehow strange to assume ...” I said, bewildered. - Absolutely crazy idea ...
Save a penny ... - I shrugged again. - Then it’s better, as they say, to stand on the porch ...
“We are fighting begging,” the lieutenant said significantly.
- Well, right, well, naturally ... I just don’t understand what I have to do with it, and ... - I caught myself on
that I shrug my shoulders a lot, and I promised myself not to do this again.
The lieutenant was silent again for an exhaustingly long time, looking at the nickel.
“We’ll have to draw up a protocol,” he said at last.
I shrugged.
- Please, of course ... although ... - I did not know what, in fact, "although."
For some time the lieutenant looked at me, waiting for the continuation. But I was just thinking
which article of the criminal code suits my actions, and then he pulled a sheet of paper towards him and
began to write.
Young Kovalev returned to his post. The lieutenant squeaked his pen and often dipped it in
inkwell. I sat idly staring at the posters hanging on the walls, idly thinking about
that in my place Lomonosov, say, would have grabbed his passport and jumped out the window. What, in fact,
essence? I thought. The bottom line is that a person does not consider himself guilty. In this sense, I am not guilty. But guilt seems to be objective and subjective. And the fact remains that all this
copper in the amount of seventy-four kopecks is legally the result of theft, carried out with the help of technical means, which is the fiat nickel ...
“Read and sign,” said the lieutenant.
I've read. From the protocol it was clear that I, the undersigned Privalov A. I., unknown
he came into possession of a working model of an unchangeable penny sample GOST 71862 and abused it; that I, the undersigned Privalov A.I., affirm that my actions
produced for the purpose of a scientific experiment without any selfish intentions; that I am ready to compensate the losses caused to the state in the amount of one ruble fifty-five kopecks; that, finally, in accordance with the decision of the Solovetsky City Council of March 22, 1959, I handed over the indicated current model of the unchangeable nickel to the officer on duty in the department, Lieutenant Sergienko
U. U. and received in return five kopecks in coins that circulate on the territory of the Soviet Union. I signed up.
The lieutenant checked my signature with the signature in the passport, again carefully counted the coppers,
called somewhere in order to clarify the cost of toffees and a primus brush, wrote out a receipt and
gave it to me along with five kopecks in circulating coinage. Returning the newspapers
matches, sweets and a brush, he said:
- And you, by your own admission, drank the water. Total from you eighty-one kopecks.
With enormous relief, I paid. The lieutenant, after carefully scrolling through again, returned
me a passport.
“You can go, citizen Privalov,” he said. “And continue to be more careful. You are in for a long time
Solovets?
“I'm leaving tomorrow,” I said.
Until tomorrow, be careful.
“Oh, I’ll try,” I said, hiding my passport. Then, obeying an impulse, he asked, lowering his voice: “Tell me, Comrade Lieutenant, is it not strange for you here in Solovets?”
The lieutenant was already looking at some papers.
“I've been here a long time,” he said absently. - I'm used to it.Chapter Five
“Do you yourself believe in ghosts?” one of the listeners asked the lecturer.
“Of course not,” the lecturer replied, and slowly vanished into thin air.
True storyUntil the evening I tried to be very careful. Straight from the office I went home
on Lukomorye and there immediately climbed under the car. It was really hot. Thunderstorm slowly crept from the west
nay black cloud. While I was lying under the car and dousing myself with oil, the old woman Naina Kievna, who had become
suddenly very affectionate and amiable, she drove up to me twice so that I would take her to Lysaya Gora.
“They say, father, it’s harmful for a car to stand,” she cooed raspily, looking under the front bumper. They say it's good for her to drive. And I would have paid, do not hesitate ... "I have to go to Bald Mountain
did not want. Firstly, the guys could arrive at any minute. Secondly, the old woman in her cooing modification was even more unpleasant to me than in her grumpy one. Further, as it turned out, it was ninety miles one way to Lysa Gora, and when I asked my grandmother about the quality of the road, she
joyfully declared that I should not worry - the road is smooth, and in which case she, the grandmother, will be herself
push the car out. (“Don’t look, father, that I’m old, I’m still very strong.”) After
the first unsuccessful attack, the old woman temporarily retreated and went into the hut. Then the cat Vasily came under my car. For a minute he carefully watched my hands, and then said in an undertone,
but clearly: “I don’t advise, citizen ... me-eh ... I don’t advise. They’ll eat it, ”and then immediately left,
wagging his tail. I wanted to be very careful, and therefore, when the grandmother went for the second time
on the attack, I, in order to end everything at once, asked her for fifty rubles. She immediately backed off.
looking at me with respect.
I did the EU and MOT, went to the gas station with the greatest care, had lunch
in dining room No. 11 and was once again subjected to a document check by the vigilant Kovalev. For
clearing my conscience, I asked him what the road was to Lysa Gora. The young sergeant looked at me with
with great disbelief and said: “The road? What are you talking about, citizen? What is the road there? No
there is no road." I returned home in the pouring rain.
The old woman left. Vasily the cat has disappeared. In the well someone sang in two voices, and it was eerie and
sadly. Soon the downpour was replaced by a dull fine rain. It became dark.
I climbed into my room and tried to experiment with a flip book. However, in
something was holding her back. Maybe I did something wrong or the weather influenced, but it was as it was,
so it remained “Practical exercises in syntax and punctuation” by F. F. Kuzmin, how much I
did not dare. It was absolutely impossible to read such a book, and I tried my luck with a mirror.
But the mirror reflected anything, and was silent. Then I lay down on the sofa and began to lie down.
From boredom and the sound of rain, I was already starting to doze off when the phone suddenly rang. I went out to
hallway and picked up the phone.
- Hello...
The tube was silent and crackling.
“Hello,” I said, and blew into the phone. – Press the button.
There was no answer.
“Knock on the phone,” I advised. The tube was silent. I blew again, pulled the cord and
said: - Call back from another machine.
Then in the tube they rudely inquired:
Is this Alexander?
- Yes. - I was surprised.
Why don't you answer?
- I answer. Who is this?
“It’s Petrovsky that worries you. Go to the pickling shop and tell the foreman to give me a call.
- Which master?
“Well, who do you have there today?”
- Don't know…
What do you mean I don't know? Is this Alexander?
“Listen, citizen,” I said. - What number are you calling?
- According to the seventy-second ... Is this the seventy-second?
I did not know.
“Apparently not,” I said.
- Why do you say that you are Alexander?
“I really am Alexander!
- Ugh! .. Is this a plant?
“No,” I said. - This is museum.
“Ah… Then I apologize. Masters, so you can not call ...
I hung up. For a while I stood looking around the hallway. There were five doors in the hallway: to my room, to the yard, to my grandmother's room, to the toilet, and another one, upholstered in iron, with a huge
padlock. Boring, I thought. Alone. And the light bulb is dim, dusty... Dragging my feet, I returned to my room and stopped on the threshold.
There was no sofa.
Everything else was completely the same: the table, and the stove, and the mirror, and the hanger, and the stool.
And the book lay on the windowsill exactly where I had left it. And on the floor, where there used to be a sofa, there was only a very dusty, littered rectangle. Then I saw the bed linen neatly folded under the hanger.
“There was a sofa here just now,” I said aloud. - I lay on it.
Something has changed in the house. The room was filled with an indistinct noise. Someone was talking
music was heard, somewhere they laughed, coughed, shuffled their feet. A vague shadow blocked the light of the bulb for a moment, and the floorboards creaked loudly. Then suddenly there was a smell of a pharmacy, and it smelled in my face
cold. I backed off. And immediately someone knocked sharply and distinctly on the outer door. Noises
subsided instantly. Looking back at the place where the sofa used to be, I went out into the hall again and opened
door.
In front of me in the fine rain stood a short, graceful man in a short cream
a cloak of perfect cleanliness with a raised collar. He took off his hat and said with dignity:
- I beg your pardon, Alexander Ivanovich. Could you give me five minutes to talk?
“Of course,” I said, confused. - Come in...
I saw this man for the first time in my life, and the thought flashed through my mind whether he was connected with the local
militia. The stranger stepped into the hallway and made a motion to go straight into my room. I got in his way. I don’t know why I did it - probably because I didn’t want to ask questions
about dust and debris on the floor.
“Excuse me,” I murmured, “maybe here? .. Otherwise, I have a mess. And nowhere to sit...
The stranger shook his head sharply.
- How - nowhere? he said softly. - And the sofa?
For a minute we silently looked into each other's eyes.
- Mmmm ... What is a sofa? I asked in a whisper for some reason.
The stranger lowered his eyelids.
- Oh, how is it? he said slowly. - Understand. It's a pity. Well, sorry...
He nodded politely, put on his hat, and walked resolutely to the toilet door.
- Where are you going? I shouted. – You not there!
The stranger, without turning around, muttered: “Ah, it doesn’t matter,” and disappeared through the door. I
mechanically turned on the light for him, stood a little, listening, then tore open the door. Nobody in the toilet
did not have. I carefully pulled out a cigarette and lit it. Sofa, I thought. What's with the sofa? Never
I haven't heard any stories about sofas. There was a flying carpet. There was a self-assembly tablecloth. There were: a cap of invisibility, walking boots, gusli-samogudy. There was a miracle mirror. And there was no miracle sofa. They sit or lie on sofas, a sofa is something durable, very ordinary ... Indeed, what fantasy could be inspired by a sofa? ..
When I returned to the room, I immediately saw the Little Man. He sat on the stove under the ceiling, crouched in a very uncomfortable position. He had a wrinkled, unshaven face and gray hairy ears.
“Hi,” I said wearily.
The Little Man twisted his long lips in pain.
“Good evening,” he said. - Excuse me, please, brought me here - I don’t understand myself
how... I'm talking about the sofa.
“You are late about the sofa,” I said, sitting down at the table.
“I see,” the Little Man said softly and shifted awkwardly. The lime fell.
I smoked, looking at him thoughtfully. The Little Man peered down uncertainly.
- Can I help you? I asked, making a move.
“No thanks,” said the Little Man despondently. - I'm better on my own...
Dirty in chalk, he crept to the edge of the couch and, awkwardly pushing off, dived headlong into
down. I sank inside, but he hung in the air and began to slowly descend, convulsively melting-
riv arms and legs. It wasn't very aesthetic, but it was fun. Landing on all fours, he now
he got up and wiped his wet face with his sleeve.
“He’s become quite an old man,” he said hoarsely. - About a hundred years ago or, say, under Gonzasta for such
descent would have deprived me of my diploma, be sure, Alexander Ivanovich.
- What did you finish? I inquired, lighting a second cigarette.
He didn't listen to me. Sitting down on a stool opposite, he continued mournfully:
“I used to levitate like Zex. And now, excuse me, I can not remove the vegetation on my ears.
It's so messy... But what if there's no talent? A huge number of temptations around, all kinds
degrees, titles, laureate awards, but no talent! Many of us grow old. Korifeev
this, of course, does not apply. Gian Giacomo, Cristobal Junta, Giuseppe Balsamo, or, say, Comrade Fyodor Simeonovich Kivrin ... No traces of vegetation! He looked up triumphantly.
on me. - No-one! Smooth skin, elegance, slimness…
“Let me,” I said. - You said - Giuseppe Balsamo ... But this is the same as Count Cagliostro! And according to Tolstoy, the count was fat and very unpleasant in appearance ...
The Little Man looked at me with regret and smiled indulgently.
“You are simply not up to date, Alexander Ivanovich,” he said. - Count Cagliostro is quite
not the same as the great Balsamo. It's… how shall I put it… It's not a very successful copy of him.
Balsamo in his youth matrixed himself. He was extraordinarily, extraordinarily talented, but you know,
how it is done in youth ... Faster, funnier - blunder, and so it will do ... Yes, sir ... Never
say that Balsamo and Cagliostro are one and the same. It might get awkward.
I felt uncomfortable.
“Yes,” I said. - Of course, I'm not an expert. But ... Forgive me for the indiscreet question, but what does
is there a sofa? Who needed it?
The Little Man shuddered.
“Inexcusable arrogance,” he said loudly and stood up. I made a mistake and
ready to confess in all decisiveness. When such giants ... And then there are arrogant boys ... -
He began to bow, pressing his pale paws to his heart. - I beg your pardon, Alexander Ivanovich, I
disturbed you so much... Once again I strongly apologize and leave you immediately. - He approached
to the stove and looked up timidly. “Old me, Alexander Ivanovich,” he said, sighing heavily. - Old...
- Or maybe it would be more convenient for you ... through ... uh ... Then a comrade came in front of you,
so he took advantage.
- And-and, my friend, it was Cristobal Junta! What is he to seep through the sewers
a dozen leagues ... - The Little Man waved his hand mournfully. - We are simpler ... He takes the sofa with him
taken or transgressed?
“I-I don’t know,” I said. The thing is, he was too late.
The Little Man, dumbfounded, pinched the hair on his right ear.
- Late? He? Incredible ... However, how can we judge this? Goodbye,
Alexander Ivanovich, forgive me generously.
He pushed through the wall with visible effort and disappeared. I threw the cigarette butt into the garbage on the floor. Ah yes
sofa! This is not a talking cat. This is something more impressive - some kind of drama. Maybe even
drama of ideas. But, perhaps, more ... latecomers will come. Surely they will come. I looked at the trash.
Where did I see a broom?
Broom stood next to the tub under the telephone. I began to sweep up dust and debris, and suddenly something caught heavily on the broom and rolled out into the middle of the room. I looked. It was brilliant
an oblong cylinder the size of an index finger. I touched it with a broom. cylinder
swayed, something crackled dryly, and the room smelled of ozone. I dropped the broom and raised the top hat. He
It was smooth, well polished and warm to the touch. I flicked my fingernail at him, and he again
crackled. I turned it to inspect it from the end, and in the same second I felt that the floor was leaving
from under my feet. Everything turned upside down before my eyes. I hit something painfully with my heels, then with my shoulder and top of my head, dropped my top hat and fell. I was very shocked and did not immediately understand that
I lie in a narrow gap between the stove and the wall. The bulb above my head was swinging, and, looking up, I
I was surprised to find the ribbed footprints of my boots on the ceiling. Grunting, I climbed out of the gap and examined the soles. There was chalk on the soles.
“However,” I thought out loud. - Do not leak into the sewer! ..
I looked around for the cylinder. He stood, touching the floor with the edge of the end, in a position that excludes any possibility of balance. I cautiously approached and knelt beside him.
The cylinder crackled softly and swayed. I looked at him for a long time, stretching my neck, then blew on
him. The cylinder swayed more strongly, leaned over, and then a hoarse scream was heard behind my back and
smelled like wind. I looked around and sat down on the floor. A gigantic vulture neatly folded its wings on the stove
with a bare neck and a sinister curved beak.
“Hello,” I said. I was convinced that the vulture was talking.
The vulture, bowing his head, looked at me with one eye and immediately became like a chicken. I waved my hand in greeting. The vulture opened its beak, but did not speak. He raised his wing and
began to search under his arm, clicking his beak. The cylinder wobbled and rattled. The vulture stopped looking, pulled his head into his shoulders and covered his eyes with a yellow film. Trying not to turn around
back to him, I finished cleaning and threw the garbage into the rainy darkness outside the door. Then I returned to
room.
The vulture was asleep, it smelled of ozone. I looked at my watch: it was twenty past one. I stood a little over the cylinder, thinking about the law of conservation of energy, and at the same time of matter. Hardly
vultures condense from nothing. If this vulture originated here, in Solovets, then some kind of vulture
(not necessarily given) disappeared in the Caucasus or where they are found there. I estimated the transfer energy and
He looked warily at the cylinder. Better not touch it, I thought. It is better to cover it with something and let it stand. I brought a ladle from the hallway, carefully aimed and, without breathing, covered it with
cylinder. Then I sat down on a stool, lit a cigarette and waited for something else. The vulture snorted distinctly. IN
In the light of the lamp, his feathers shone with copper, huge claws dug into the lime. The smell of rot slowly spread from him.“You shouldn’t have done it, Alexander Ivanovich,” said a pleasant male voice.
- What exactly? I asked, looking at the mirror.
“I mean umklidet…
It wasn't the mirror that spoke. Someone else spoke.
“I don’t understand what you are talking about,” I said. There was no one in the room, and I felt annoyed.
“I’m talking about the umklidet,” said the voice. “You absolutely vainly covered him with an iron ladle. The Umklidet, or wand as you call it, requires extremely careful handling.
- That's why I covered ... Yes, you come in, comrade, otherwise it’s very uncomfortable to talk like that.
“Thank you,” said the voice.
Right in front of me slowly condensed a pale, very correct person in
perfectly fitting gray suit. Tilting his head somewhat to one side, he inquired with the most refined courtesy:
"I dare to hope I haven't troubled you too much?"
“Not at all,” I said, getting up. “Please sit down and make yourself at home. Would you like a seagull?
“Thank you,” said the stranger, and sat down across from me, tucking up his trousers in a graceful gesture. - As for tea, I beg your pardon, Alexander Ivanovich, I just had supper.
For some time he looked into my eyes with a secular smile. I smiled too.
- Are you talking about the sofa? - I said. Unfortunately no sofa. I'm sorry and I don't even
I know…
The stranger threw up his hands.
- What nonsense! - he said. - How much noise because of some, excuse me, nonsense, in which
besides, no one really believes ... Judge for yourself, Alexander Ivanovich, arrange squabbles,
ugly movie chases, disturbing people because of the mythical - I'm not afraid of this word - namely
mythical White Thesis… Every sober-minded person considers a sofa as a universal translator, somewhat bulky, but very solid and stable in work. And all the more ridiculous are the old ignoramuses talking about the White Thesis... No, I don't even want to talk about this couch.
“As you please,” I said, concentrating all my worldliness in this phrase. - Let's talk about something else.
“Superstition… Prejudice…” the stranger said absently. - Sloth of mind and envy,
envy, hairy envy…” He interrupted himself. - Excuse me, Alexander Ivanovich,
but I would still dare to ask your permission to remove this ladle. Unfortunately, iron
is practically opaque for the hyperfield, and the increase in the strength of the hyperfield in a small volume ...
I raised my hands.
- For God's sake, whatever you want! Remove the ladle ... Remove even this very ... mind ... mind ...
this magic wand ... - Here I stopped, to my astonishment to find that the ladle was no more.
The cylinder stood in a pool of liquid that looked like colored mercury. The liquid quickly evaporated.
“It will be better, I assure you,” said the stranger. “As for your generous
offer to remove the umklidet, I, unfortunately, cannot use it. This is already a matter of morality and ethics, a matter of honor, if you like... Conventions are so strong! I take the liberty of advising you
no more touching the umclidete. I see you hurt yourself, and this eagle... I think you feel...
uh… some amber…
“Yes,” I said with feeling. - It stinks bad. Like in a monkey house.
We looked at the eagle. The vulture, fluffed up, dozed off.
“The art of controlling the umklidet,” said the stranger, “is a complex and subtle art.
In no case should you be upset or reproach yourself. The umklidet management course takes eight semesters and requires a thorough knowledge of quantum alchemy. As a programmer you
probably, without much difficulty they would have mastered the umklidet of the electronic level, the so-called UEU-17 ...
But the quantum umklidet… hyperfields… transgressive incarnations… the generalized Lomonosov-Lavoisier law…” He spread his hands guiltily.
- What are you talking about! I said hastily. - I don’t pretend to ... Of course, I absolutely don’t
prepared.
Then I caught myself and offered him a cigarette.
“Thank you,” said the stranger. - I do not use, to my great regret.
Then, wiggling my fingers out of politeness, I inquired—I didn’t ask, I just inquired:
“Will I be allowed to know to what I owe the pleasantness of our meeting?”
The stranger lowered his eyes.
“I’m afraid to seem immodest,” he said, “but, alas, I must confess that I’ve had enough
I've been here for a long time. I don't want to name names, but I think even you, no matter how far you are
from all this, Alexander Ivanovich, it is clear that some unhealthy fuss has arisen around the sofa,
a scandal is brewing, the atmosphere is heating up, tension is growing. In such an environment, it is inevitable
mistakes, extremely undesirable accidents... We won't go far for examples. Someone -
I repeat, I would not like to name names, especially since this is an employee worthy of every
respect, and speaking of respect, I mean, if not manners, then great talent and self-sacrificing
ness, - and so, someone, hurrying and nervous, loses umklidet here, and umklidet becomes the center
spheres of events in which a person is involved, who is completely uninvolved in them ... -
He bowed in my direction. “And in such cases, it is absolutely necessary to have an impact that somehow neutralizes harmful influences ...” He looked significantly at the prints of boots on the ceiling. Then he smiled at me. “But I would not like to seem like an abstract altruist. Of course, all these
events are of great interest to me as a specialist and as an administrator ... However, I do not intend to
interfere with you any more, and since you have given me the confidence that you will no longer experiment with umklidet, I will ask your permission to take my leave.
He got up.
- Well, what are you! I cried. - Do not leave! I am so pleased to talk with you, I have a thousand questions for you! ..
- I highly appreciate your delicacy, Alexander Ivanovich, but you are tired, you need to rest ...
- Not at all! I objected hotly. - Vice versa!
“Alexander Ivanovich,” said the stranger, smiling affectionately and looking intently into my eyes. “But you are really tired. And you really want to relax.
And then I felt like I was really falling asleep. My eyes drooped. Talk no more
wanted. I didn't want anything more. I was terribly sleepy.
“It was an exceptional pleasure to meet you,” said the stranger in a low voice.
I saw how he began to turn pale, turn pale and slowly vanished into the air, leaving behind
a slight smell of expensive cologne. I somehow spread the mattress on the floor, poked my face into the pillow and
fell asleep instantly.
I was awakened by the flapping of wings and an unpleasant scream. There was a strange bluish twilight in the room. The eagle on the stove rustled, yelled vilely and beat its wings on the ceiling. I sat down and looked around.
In the middle of the room, a huge fellow in sweatpants and a striped shirt floated in the air.
loose Hawaiian. He hovered over the cylinder and, without touching it, smoothly waved his huge bony paws.
- What's the matter? I asked.
The kid glanced at me from under his shoulder and turned away.
“I don’t hear an answer,” I said angrily. I still really wanted to sleep.
“Quiet, you mortal,” the kid said hoarsely. He stopped his passes and took the cylinder with
gender. His voice sounded familiar to me.
- Hey buddy! I said threateningly. “Put that thing back and clear the room.
The kid was looking at me, jutting out his jaw. I pushed back the sheet and stood up.
“Come on, put down the umklidet!” I said out loud.
The kid sank to the floor and, firmly resting his feet, took a stance. The room became much
brighter, even though the bulb was not on.
“Baby,” said the kid, “you need to sleep at night. Better lie down.
The guy was clearly not a fool to fight. However, I do too.
- Shall we go outside? I suggested businesslike, pulling up my shorts.
Someone suddenly said with an expression:
– “Having directed your thoughts to the higher Self, free from lust and selfishness, healed from
mental fever, fight, Arjuna!
I started. The guy winced too.
- "Bhagavad Gita"! said the voice. - Canto 3, verse 30.
"It's a mirror," I said mechanically.
“I know it myself,” the kid grumbled.
“Put down the umklidet,” I demanded.
Why are you yelling like a sick elephant? – said the guy. - Is he yours?
- Or maybe yours?
- Yes, mine!
Here it dawned on me.
- So you dragged the sofa too?
"Don't mind your own business," the boy advised.
“Give me back the sofa,” I said. - He has a receipt.
- Go to hell! – said the kid, looking around.
And then two more people appeared in the room: a skinny one and a fat one, both in striped pajamas, similar to
prisoners of Sing Sing.
- Korneev! yelled the fat one. “So you’re stealing the sofa?! What a disgrace!
“Go on, all of you…” the kid said.
- You are a brute! the fat man shouted. - You must be chased! I'll file a report on you!
“Well, serve it,” said Korneev gloomily. - Do what you love.
"Don't you dare talk to me like that!" You are a boy! You are cheeky! you forgot here
umclidet! The young man could have been hurt!
"I've already been hurt," I intervened. - No sofa, sleep like a dog, every night talking ...
That smelly eagle...
The fat man immediately turned to me.
“An unheard-of breach of discipline,” he said. - You should complain ... And you should
be ashamed! He turned back to Korneev.
Korneev sullenly stuffed the umklidet into his cheek. The skinny man suddenly asked quietly and menacingly:
– Did you film the Thesis, Korneev?
The kid smiled grimly.
“There is no Thesis there,” he said. - What are you all up to? Don't want us to sofa
stole - give us another translator ...
- Have you read the order on non-withdrawal of items from the store? the skinny man inquired menacingly.
Korneev put his hands in his pockets and stared up at the ceiling.
– Do you know the decision of the Academic Council? the skinny one inquired.
“I know, Comrade Demin, that Monday begins on Saturday,” said Korneev sullenly.
“Don’t spread demagogy,” said the skinny one. - Immediately return the sofa and do not dare to come here
return more.
“I won’t return the sofa,” said Korneev. - We will finish the experiment - we will return it.
Tolstoy made an ugly scene. “Arbitrariness! ..” he squealed. – Hooliganism!..» Vulture
yelled excitedly again. Korneev, without taking his hands out of his pockets, turned his back and stepped
through the wall. The fat man rushed after him, shouting: “No, you will return the sofa!” Skinny told me:
- It's a misunderstanding. We will take steps to ensure it doesn't happen again.
He nodded and also moved towards the wall.
- Wait! I cried. - Orla! Take the eagle! Along with the scent!
Skinny, already halfway into the wall, turned around and beckoned the eagle with his finger. The vulture noisily fell off the stove and was pulled under his nail. Skinny disappeared. The blue light slowly faded, it became dark,
The rain beat against the window again. I turned on the light and looked around the room. Everything in the room was the same, only deep scratches from the claws of a vulture gaped on the stove, and wildly and ridiculously on the ceiling.
the ribbed footprints of my boots darkened.
“The clear oil in a cow,” the mirror said with idiotic profundity, “does not contribute to its nutrition, but it provides the best nutrition when processed in the proper way.
I turned off the light and lay down. The floor was hard and cold. I will have tomorrow from the old woman,
I thought.Chapter Six
“No,” he said in response to the persistent question of my eyes, “I am not a member of the club, I am a ghost.
“Okay, but that doesn’t give you the right to walk around the club.
H. J. WellsIn the morning it turned out that the sofa was in place. I wasn't surprised. I just thought that somehow
the old woman has achieved her goal: the sofa is in one corner, and I am lying in the other. As I made my bed and did my exercises, I thought that there was probably some limit to the capacity for surprise.
Apparently, I have stepped far beyond this limit. I even experienced some fatigue. I have tried
imagine something that could amaze me now, but I don’t have enough imagination
lo. I really didn't like that, because I can't stand people who can't be surprised.
True, I was far from the psychology of "think of it," rather, my state resembled the state of Alice in Wonderland: I was like in a dream and accepted and was ready to accept any miracle for
due, requiring a more detailed reaction than simple gaping of the mouth and blinking of the eyes.
I was still exercising when a door slammed in the hallway, heels shuffled and clattered, someone
coughed, something rattled and fell, and an authoritative voice called: "Comrade Gorynych!" Old woman
did not respond, and in the hallway they began to talk: “What kind of door is this? .. Ah, I understand. And this? - "Here
entrance to the museum. - “And here? .. What is it - everything is locked, locks ...” - “A very economic woman, Janus
Poluektovich. And this is a phone." “Where is the famous sofa? In the museum?" - "No. There should be
reserve."
"It's here," said a familiar sullen voice.
The door of my room swung open, and a tall, thin old man with magnificent snow-white gray hair, black-browed and black mustache, with deep black eyes, appeared on the threshold. Seeing
me (I was standing in my shorts, arms to the sides, feet shoulder-width apart), he paused and sonorously
said in a voice:
- So.
To the right and left of him other faces peered into the room. I said, "I'm sorry," and ran to my jeans. However, they paid no attention to me. Four people entered the room and crowded around the sofa. I knew two: gloomy Korneev, unshaven, with red eyes,
still in the same frivolous Hawaiian shirt, and swarthy, hook-nosed Roman, who winked at me, made an incomprehensible sign with his hand and immediately turned away. I did not know the gray-haired one. Nor did I know a stout, tall man in a black suit, shining from the back, and with broad masterly movements.
- This sofa? asked the shiny man.
“This is not a sofa,” said Korneev sullenly. - It's a translator.
“For me, it’s a sofa,” said the shiny one, looking into his notebook. - The sofa is soft, one and a half, inventory number eleven twenty-three. He leaned over and touched. - Here you have it
wet, Korneev, dragged in the rain. Now consider: the springs are rusted, the skin is rotten.
– The value of this item, – as it seemed to me, mockingly said hook-nosed Roman, – is by no means in the sheathing and not even in the springs, which are not there.
“Stop it, Roman Petrovich,” the shiny one offered with dignity. - You don’t shield your Korneev for me. The sofa passes through my museum and should be there ...
“This is a device,” said Korneev hopelessly. - Working with him...
“That I don’t know,” declared the shiny one. – I don’t know what kind of work with a sofa is. I have here
there is also a sofa at home, and I know how people work on it.
“We know that too,” Roman said softly.
“You will stop this,” said the shiny one, turning to him. - You are not in the pub here, you
here at the institution. What do you actually mean?“I mean it's not a sofa,” Roman said. - Or, in a form accessible to you, it is
there is not quite a sofa. This is a device that has the appearance of a sofa.
“I would ask you to stop these hints,” the shiny one said resolutely. - About available
forms and all. Let's each do our part. My business is to stop squandering, and I
stop.
"Yes," the gray-haired man said loudly. It immediately became quiet. – I spoke with Cristobal Hosevich and
with Fedor Simeonovich. They believe that this translator sofa is only a museum piece.
value. At one time it belonged to King Rudolf II, so the historical value
its undeniable. In addition, two years ago, if my memory serves me right, we already ordered a serial translator ... Who ordered it, do you remember, Modest Matveyevich?
“Just a minute,” said the shiny Modest Matveyevich, and quickly began flipping through his notebook.
book. – Just a minute… Two-way translator TDH-80E of the Kitezhgrad plant… On request
Comrade Balsamo.
“Balsamo works on it around the clock,” Roman said.
“And this TDH is junk,” Korneev added. – Selectivity at the molecular level.
“Yes, yes,” the gray-haired man said. - I remember. There was a report on the TDH study. Action-
Therefore, the selectivity curve is not smooth... Yes. And this… er… sofa?
“Manual labor,” Roman said quickly. - Reliable. Designs by Leo Ben Bezalel. Ben Bezalel has been collecting and debugging it for three hundred years ...
- Here! - said the shiny Modest Matveyevich. - That's how it should work! The old man did everything
myself.
The mirror suddenly coughed and said:
- All of them rejuvenated after spending an hour in the water, and came out of it as beautiful, pink, young and healthy, strong and cheerful as they were at twenty years old.
“Exactly,” said Modest Matveyevich. The mirror spoke in the voice of a gray-haired man.
The gray-haired man grimaced in annoyance.
"Let's not decide this issue now," he said.
- And when? asked the rude Korneev.
- Friday at the Academic Council.
“We cannot squander relics,” put in Modest Matveyevich.
– And what are we going to do? asked the rude Korneev.
The mirror murmured in a menacing sepulchral voice:
I myself saw how, having picked up black dresses,
Canidia walked barefoot, bare-haired, howling,
With her and Sagan, older in years, and both pale.
They looked terrible. Here they began the earth with their nails
Both dig and tear the black with the teeth of a lamb ...
The gray-haired man, all wrinkled, went up to the mirror, put his hand into it up to his shoulder and with something
clicked. The mirror was silent.
“Yes,” the gray-haired man said. - We will also decide on the issue of your group at the council. And you... -
it was evident on his face that he had forgotten Korneev's name and patronymic - for the time being, you refrain ... er ... from visiting the museum.
With these words, he left the room. Through the door
“We got our way,” said Korneev through gritted teeth, looking at Modest Matveyevich.
“I won’t let you squander it,” he answered curtly, thrusting a note into his inner pocket.
book.
- Squander! Korneev said. - You don't care about any of this. You are worried about reporting. It is reluctant to enter an extra column.
“You will stop this,” said the adamant Modest Matveyevich. - We will appoint a commission
and see if the relic is damaged...
“Inventory number eleven twenty-three,” Roman added in an undertone.
“In such an acceptance,” Modest Matveyevich said majestically, turned and saw me. – What are you doing here? he inquired. - Why are you sleeping here?
“I…” I began.
“You slept on the couch,” Modest announced in an icy tone, piercing me with the eyes of a counterintelligence officer. Do you know what this device is?
“No,” I said. - That is now known, of course.
- Modest Matveyevich! exclaimed the hook-nosed Roman. – This is our new programmer, Sasha.
Privalov!
Why is he sleeping here? Why not in a hostel?
“He's not enrolled yet,” Roman said, putting his arm around my waist.
- Especially!
- So, let him sleep on the street? Korneev asked angrily.
“You will stop this,” said Modest. - There is a hostel, there is a hotel, and here is a museum, a state institution. If everyone sleeps in museums… Where are you from?
“From Leningrad,” I said grimly.
- What if I come to Leningrad and go to sleep in the Hermitage?
“Please,” I said, shrugging.
Roman kept holding me by the waist.
- Modest Matveyevich, you are absolutely right, it's a mess, but today he will spend the night with me.
- That's another matter. This is please, - generously allowed Modest. He is a master's eye
looked around the room, saw prints on the ceiling and immediately looked at my feet. Luckily I was
barefoot. “In such an acceptance,” he said, straightened the junk on the hanger and went out.
“D-club,” Korneev squeezed out of himself. - Stump. He sat down on the sofa and shook his head. - well them
all to hell. Tonight, I'll take it down again.
"Calm down," Roman said softly. - It's OK. We're just a little unlucky. You
notice what kind of Janus it is?
- Well? - said Korneev hopelessly.
“It's A-Janus.
Korneev raised his head.
- And what's the difference?
– Huge, – Roman said and winked. – Because U-Janus flew to Moscow. And in particular
about this sofa. Understood, plunderer of museum valuables?
“Listen, you are saving me,” said Korneev, and for the first time I saw him smile.
“The thing is, Sasha,” Roman said, turning to me, “that we have an ideal director. He
one in two persons. There is A-Janus Poluektovich and U-Janus Poluektovich. U-Janus is a great scientist
international class. As for A-Janus, he is a rather ordinary administrator.
- Twins? I asked carefully.
No, it's the same person. Only he is one in two faces.
“I see,” I said, and began to put on my boots.
“Nothing, Sasha, you’ll soon find out everything,” Roman said encouragingly.
I raised my head.
- That is?
“We need a programmer,” Roman said heartily.
“I really need a programmer,” said Korneev, brightening up.
“Everyone needs a programmer,” I said, returning to my boots. - And I ask without hypnosis and all sorts of enchanted places.
“He already knows,” said Roman.
Korneev wanted to say something, but shouts broke out outside the window.
- This is not our penny! shouted Modest.
- And whose penny is this?
- I don't know whose penny it is! It's none of my business! It's your job to catch counterfeiters, comrade sergeant!..
- Pyatak was confiscated from a certain Privalov, who lives here with you, in Iznakurnozh! ..
- Oh, at Privalov's? I immediately thought he was a thief!
The reproachful voice of A-Janus said:
- Well, well, Modest Matveyevich! ..
- No, sorry, Janus Poluektovich! You can't leave it like this! Comrade Sergeant, let's go!
He's in the house... Janus Poluektovich, stand by the window so he doesn't jump out! I'll prove! I will not let
cast a shadow on Comrade Gorynych!...
I feel bad inside. But Roman had already assessed the situation. He grabbed from the hanger
greasy cap and put it on my ears.
I disappeared.
It was a very strange feeling. Everything remained in place, everything except me. But Roman did not
I am filled with new experiences.
"It's an invisibility cap," he hissed. - Step aside and shut up.
I tiptoed back to the corner and sat under the mirror. At the same moment, an excited Modest burst into the room, dragging the young sergeant Kovalev by the sleeve.
- Where is he? yelled Modest, looking around.
“Here,” Roman said, pointing to the sofa.
“Don’t worry, it’s standing still,” Korneev added.
- I'm asking, where is this your ... programmer?
- What programmer? Roman was surprised.
“You will stop this,” said Modest. There was a programmer here. He stood in trousers and no boots
nok.
"Ah, that's what you mean," said Roman. “But we were joking, Modest Matveyevich. Not
there was no programmer here. It was just…” He made some movement with his hands, and a man in a T-shirt and jeans appeared in the middle of the room. I saw him from the back and nothing to say about him
I can’t, but young Kovalyov shook his head and said:
- No, it is not him.
Modest circled the ghost, muttering:
- T-shirt ... pants ... no shoes ... He! It is he.
The ghost is gone.
“No, it’s not the same one,” said Sergeant Kovalev. - He was young, without a beard ...
- Without a beard? Modest asked. He was very embarrassed.
“Without a beard,” Kovalev confirmed.
“Hmmm…” said Modest. I think he had a beard...
“So I am handing you a summons,” said young Kovalyov, and handed Modest a piece of government-issued paper. - And you yourself deal with your Privalov and your Gorynych ...
- And I'm telling you that this is not our penny! shouted Modest. - I don’t say anything about Privalov,
maybe there is no Privalov as such ... But Comrade Gorynych is our employee! ..
Young Kovalev, pressing his hands to his chest, tried to say something.
“I want it sorted out immediately!” yelled Modest. “Stop it for me, comrade militia! This agenda casts a shadow on the entire team! I demand that you make sure!
- I have an order ... - Kovalev began, but Modest shouted: “You stop this! I insist!" - rushed at him and dragged him out of the room.
“He took me to the museum,” said Roman. - Sasha, where are you? Take off your cap, let's go see...
“Maybe it’s better not to shoot?” - I said.
“Take off, take off,” said Roman. You are now a phantom. Now no one believes in you - neither the administration, nor the police ...
Korneev said:
Well, I went to bed. Sasha, you come after dinner. Take a look at our fleet of cars and in general ...
I took off my hat.
“You stop this,” I said. - I'm on vacation.
"Let's go, let's go," said Roman.
In the hallway, Modest, clinging to the sergeant with one hand, with the other unlocked a powerful hanging
lock. “Now I’ll show you our penny! he shouted. “Everything is credited… Everything is in place.” - "Yes I
I don’t say anything,” Kovalev weakly defended himself. - I'm just saying that there may not be nickels
alone…” Modest opened the door, and we all entered a large room.
It was quite a decent museum - with stands, diagrams, showcases, models and models. The general view most of all resembled a museum of criminology: many photographs and unappetizing
exhibits. Modest immediately dragged the sergeant somewhere behind the stands, and there they both hummed like a barrel: “Here is our penny ...” - “But I don’t say anything ...” - “Comrade Gorynych ...” - “And I have an order !. ."
“You will stop this for me!”
“Be curious, be curious, Sasha,” Roman said, made a grand gesture and sat down in an armchair at the entrance.
I went along the wall. I wasn't surprised at anything. I was just very interested. “Water is alive.
Efficiency 52%. Permissible sediment 0.3 "(an old rectangular bottle of water, the cork is filled with colored wax). "Scheme of industrial extraction of living water". "Layout of a live-water distillation cube". "Veshkovsky-Traubenbach's love potion" (pharmaceutical jar with poisonous yellow

A sign hung on the stand: “Active chemicals. XII-XVIII centuries. There were many more bottles, jars, retorts, ampoules, test tubes, working and non-working models of installations for

languidly read aloud: "Go-munku-lus laboratory, general view" - and went on.
I followed him, feeling bad. Roman was waiting for us at the door.
- Well, how? - he asked.
“A disgrace,” said Modest languidly. - Bureaucrats.
“I have an order,” Sergeant Kovalev repeated stubbornly from the hallway.
“Well, come out, Roman Petrovich, come out,” said Modest, jingling his keys.
The novel is out. I tried to follow him, but Modest stopped me.
“I'm sorry,” he said. – Where are you?
- How - where? I asked in a low voice.
- Go to the place, go to the place.
- To what place?
- Well, where are you standing there? Excuse me, are you ... ham-munculs? So stay where you are...
I realized that I was dead. And I probably would have died, because Roman, apparently, was also confused,
but at that moment Naina Kievna burst into the hall with a clatter and a thud, leading a hefty black goat on a rope. At the sight of the militia sergeant, the goat let out an evil voice and rushed
away. Naina Kievna fell. Modest rushed into the hallway, and an unimaginable noise arose. An empty tub rolled with a roar. Roman grabbed my hand and, whispering: “Go, go! ..” – rushed into my room. We slammed the door behind us and leaned against it, breathing heavily. In the hall
shouted:
- Submit your documents!
- Father, what is it!
- Why a goat? Why is there a goat in the room?!
- Me-ee-e-e-e...
“Stop this, this is not a beer garden!”
- I don’t know your nickels and I don’t know!
- Meeeee!..
- Citizen, remove the goat!
- Stop it, the goat is credited!
- How credited?
- It's not a goat! This is our employee!
- Then let him present! ..
- Through the window - and into the car! Roman ordered.
I grabbed my jacket and jumped out the window. Basil the cat shied away from under my feet with a meow. Bending down, I ran to the car, opened the door and jumped behind the wheel. Roman was already rolling back the collar.
The motor didn't start. Tormenting the starter, I saw how the door of the hut swung open, flew out of the hallway
the black goat and giant leaps rushed away somewhere around the corner. The motor roared. I unrolled
car and drove out into the street. The oak gate slammed shut with a bang. Roman emerged from the gate
and sat down beside me.
- Go! he said cheerfully. - To the center!
When we turned onto Mira Avenue, he asked:
- Well, how do you like us?
“I like it,” I said. - It's just very noisy.
“Naina's is always noisy,” said Roman. - A naughty old woman. Did she hate you?
“No,” I said. - We almost did not communicate.
“Wait a minute,” said Roman. - Slow down.
- And what?
- And there Volodya is coming. Do you remember Volodya?
I slowed down. The bearded Volodya climbed into the back seat and, smiling happily, shook hands with us.
- That's great! - he said. - I'm on my way to you!
“The only thing missing was you,” Roman said.
- And how did it all end?
“Nothing,” said Roman.
– Where are you going now?
“To the institute,” said Roman.
- For what? I asked.
“Work,” said Roman.
- I'm on vacation.
"It doesn't matter," Roman said. – Monday starts on Saturday, and this time August starts in July!
“The guys are waiting for me,” I said pleadingly.
“We take care of that,” said Roman. The kids won't notice at all.
“Go crazy,” I said.
We drove between store number 2 and dining room number 11.
“He already knows where to go,” Volodya remarked.
“Great guy,” Roman said. - Giant!
“I liked him right away,” Volodya said.
“Apparently you desperately need a programmer,” I said.
“We don't need just any programmer,” Roman objected.
I stopped near a strange building with a sign "NIICHAVO" between the windows.
- What does this mean? I asked. “May I at least find out where I am being forced to work?”
“You can,” said Roman. - You can do anything now. This is a Research Institute
Sorcery and Magic… Well, what have you become? Drive the car!
- Where? I asked.
“Well, don’t you see?
And I saw.
But that's a completely different story.Story two
VANITY
Chapter first
Among the heroes of the story, one or two main characters stand out, all the rest are considered as
secondary.
"Methods of teaching literature"At about two o'clock in the afternoon, when the fuse of the input device blew again in Aldan,
the phone rang. The deputy director for the administrative and economic part, Modest Matveyevich Kamnoedov, called.
“Privalov,” he said sternly, “why are you not there again?”
