Series: NIICHAVO - 1But what is strange, what is most incomprehensible, is how authors can take such plots,
I confess, this is completely incomprehensible, that's for sure ... no, no, I don’t understand at all.

THE FUSION AROUND THE SOFAChapter first
Teacher: Children, write down the sentence: "The fish was sitting on a tree."
Student: Do fish sit on trees?
Teacher: Well... It was a crazy fish.
School jokeI was approaching my destination. Around me, clinging to the very road, green
forest, occasionally giving way to clearings overgrown with yellow sedge. The sun has been setting for an hour now
still could not sit down and hung low over the horizon. The car rolled along a narrow road covered with crisp gravel. I let large stones under the wheel, and every time they clanged in the trunk
and empty canisters rumbled.
On the right, two people came out of the forest, stepped onto the side of the road and stopped, looking in my direction. One of
them raised their hand. I let off the gas as I looked at them. They were, it seemed to me, hunters, young
people maybe a little older than me. I liked their faces and I stopped. The one who raised his hand stuck his swarthy hook-nosed face into the car and asked, smiling:
- You will not give us a lift to Solovets?
The second, with a red beard and no mustache, was also smiling, peering over his shoulder. Positive-
but they were nice people.
"Let's sit down," I said. - One forward, the other back, otherwise I have junk there, in the back
seat.
- Benefactor! - the hawk-nosed one said delightedly, took off his gun from his shoulder and sat down next to me.
The bearded man, looking hesitantly through the back door, said:
“Can I have a little of that here?”
I leaned over the back and helped him clear the space occupied by the sleeping bag and the rolled-up tent. He sat down delicately, placing the gun between his knees.
“Close the door better,” I said.
Everything went on as usual. The car started off. The hawk-nosed man turned back and spoke animatedly about the fact that it is much more pleasant to ride in a passenger car than to walk. The bearded man indistinctly agreed and kept slamming and slamming the door. “Pick up your raincoat,” I advised, looking at him in the mirror.

for some reason they laughed. I pulled out cigarettes, lit a cigarette and offered them a treat. "Clara's Factory"

“I'm traveling,” I said. “Are you from here?” “Indigenous,” said the hawk-nosed one. "I'm from Murmansk," the bearded man said. “For Leningrad, probably, Solovets and Murmansk are one and the same:
North,” said the hawk-nosed one. "No, why not," I said politely. “Are you going to stop in Solovets?” asked the hawk-nosed one. “Of course,” I said. “I am going to Solovets.” “Do you have relatives there or
familiar?" “No,” I said. I'll just wait guys. They go along the coast, and Solovets is our dot
rendezvous."
Ahead, I saw a large scattering of stones, slowed down and said: "Hold on tight." The car shook and jumped. Hook-nosed bruised his nose on the barrel of a gun. The motor roared, the stones beat in
bottom. "Poor car," said the hawk-nosed one. “What to do…” I said. “Not everyone would go
such a road in your car. “I would go,” I said. The spill is over. "Oh, it's not yours.

hook-nosed, as it seemed to me, disappointed. I felt hurt. “What’s the point of buying a car to drive on asphalt? Where there is asphalt, there is nothing interesting, and where it is interesting, there is no asphalt.” “Yes, of course,” the hook-nosed man agreed politely. "It's stupid, in my opinion, to do

about cars and came to the conclusion that if you really buy anything, it's the GAZ-69, an all-terrain vehicle, but they,
unfortunately not for sale. Then the hawk-nosed one asked: “Where do you work?” I answered. “Colossal! exclaimed the hunchback. - Programmer! We need a programmer. Listen, leave your institute and come to us!” “What do you have?” “What do we have?” - asked the hook-nosed
turning around. "Aldan-3," said the bearded one. “Rich car,” I said. “And does it work well?”
- "Yes, how can I tell you ..." - "Understood," - I said. “Actually, it has not yet been debugged,” said the bearded one. - Stay with us, debug ... "-" And we will arrange the translation for you in no time, "- added the hook-nosed one. "What are you doing?" I asked. “Like all science,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Human happiness.” “Understood,” I said. “Something with space?” “And with space too,” he said.

you won't be anywhere." - "Why do you think so?" - "Sure". “I'm not sure.” The hawk-nosed chuckled. “We will talk about this again,” he said. “Will you stay in Solovets for a long time?” - "Two days
maximum". “We’ll talk on the second day.” The bearded one said: “Personally, I see in this a finger

do you need a programmer? I asked. "We desperately need a programmer." “I'll talk to the guys,” I promised. “I know those who are dissatisfied.” “We don't need just any programmer,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Programmers are a scarce people, they are spoiled, but we need an unspoilt one.” - "Yes it

one hundred and twenty rubles. “What about wings? I asked. “Or, shall we say, lights around the head?” One in a thousand!" “We only need one,” said the hawk-nosed one. “And if there are only nine hundred of them?” “Nine-tenths agree.”
The forest parted, we crossed the bridge and rolled between the potato fields. "Nine

“The car can be parked near the police,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Yes, this is nonsense,” said the bearded man. - I'm talking nonsense, and you follow me. How will he get into the hostel? “Y-yeah, hell,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Really, if you don’t work for a day, you forget about all these things.” – “Maybe
maybe transgress it? “Well, well,” said the hawk-nosed one. This is not your sofa. And you are not Cristobal Junta, and neither am I ... "
“Don't worry,” I said. I'll sleep in the car, not the first time.
I suddenly felt like sleeping on sheets. I've been sleeping in the bedroom for four nights

“Listen,” said the hook-nosed one, “ho-ho!” Out of the knife!
- Right! exclaimed the bearded man. - On Lukomorye it!
"By God, I'll sleep in the car," I said.
“You will spend the night in the house,” said the hawk-nosed one, “on relatively clean linen. Should we
thank you somehow...
“It’s not a fifty kopeck for you to poke,” said the bearded one.
We entered the city. Ancient strong fences stretched out, powerful log cabins made of giant blackened logs, with narrow windows, with carved platbands, with wooden cockerels on
roofs. I came across several dirty brick buildings with iron doors, the sight of which brought the semi-familiar word "storage" out of my memory. The street was straight and wide and was called Mira Avenue. Ahead, closer to the center, one could see two-story cinder-block houses with open
public gardens.
“Next alley to the right,” said the hawk-nosed one.
I turned on the turn signal, braked and turned right. The road here is overgrown with grass,
but at some gate stood, crouching, a brand new "Zaporozhets". House numbers hung over the gates, and the numbers were barely visible on the rusty tin of the signs. The lane was elegantly called: “St.
Lukomorye. It was not wide and wedged between heavy old fences, set up, probably
back in the days when Swedish and Norwegian pirates roamed here.
“Stop,” said the hawk-nosed one. I braked and he bumped his nose against the barrel of the gun again. - Now
yes,” he said, rubbing his nose. - You wait for me, and I'll go and arrange everything.
“Really, it’s not worth it,” I said for the last time.
- No talking. Volodya, keep him at gunpoint.
Hook-nosed got out of the car and, bending down, squeezed through the low gate. Behind the tall
the gray fence of the house was not visible. The gates were absolutely phenomenal, as in a locomotive depot, on rusty iron hinges weighing a pound. I read the signs with amazement. There were three. On the left
In the gate, a solid blue signboard with silver letters sternly gleamed with thick glass:
NIICHAVO
Hut on chicken legs
Monument of Solovetsky antiquity
A rusty tin plate hung on top of the right collar: “St. Lukomorye, d. No. 13, N. K.
Gorynych”, and under it was a piece of plywood with an inscription at random in ink:
