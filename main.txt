Series: NIICHAVO - 1But what is strange, what is most incomprehensible, is how authors can take such plots,
I confess, this is completely incomprehensible, that's for sure ... no, no, I don’t understand at all.

THE FUSION AROUND THE SOFAChapter first
Teacher: Children, write down the sentence: "The fish was sitting on a tree."
Student: Do fish sit on trees?
Teacher: Well... It was a crazy fish.
School jokeI was approaching my destination. Around me, clinging to the very road, green
forest, occasionally giving way to clearings overgrown with yellow sedge. The sun has been setting for an hour now
still could not sit down and hung low over the horizon. The car rolled along a narrow road covered with crisp gravel. I let large stones under the wheel, and every time they clanged in the trunk
and empty canisters rumbled.
On the right, two people came out of the forest, stepped onto the side of the road and stopped, looking in my direction. One of
them raised their hand. I let off the gas as I looked at them. They were, it seemed to me, hunters, young
people maybe a little older than me. I liked their faces and I stopped. The one who raised his hand stuck his swarthy hook-nosed face into the car and asked, smiling:
- You will not give us a lift to Solovets?
The second, with a red beard and no mustache, was also smiling, peering over his shoulder. Positive-
but they were nice people.
"Let's sit down," I said. - One forward, the other back, otherwise I have junk there, in the back
seat.
- Benefactor! - the hawk-nosed one said delightedly, took off his gun from his shoulder and sat down next to me.
The bearded man, looking hesitantly through the back door, said:
“Can I have a little of that here?”
I leaned over the back and helped him clear the space occupied by the sleeping bag and the rolled-up tent. He sat down delicately, placing the gun between his knees.
“Close the door better,” I said.
Everything went on as usual. The car started off. The hawk-nosed man turned back and spoke animatedly about the fact that it is much more pleasant to ride in a passenger car than to walk. The bearded man indistinctly agreed and kept slamming and slamming the door. “Pick up your raincoat,” I advised, looking at him in the mirror.

bearded in the back seat. "Who is speaking?" asked the hawk-nosed one. Merlin speaks. They
for some reason they laughed. I pulled out cigarettes, lit a cigarette and offered them a treat. "Clara's Factory"
Zetkin,” said the hawk-nosed one, looking at the pack. Are you from Leningrad? - "Yes". - "Are you traveling?"
“I'm traveling,” I said. “Are you from here?” “Indigenous,” said the hawk-nosed one. "I'm from Murmansk," the bearded man said. “For Leningrad, probably, Solovets and Murmansk are one and the same:
North,” said the hawk-nosed one. "No, why not," I said politely. “Are you going to stop in Solovets?” asked the hawk-nosed one. “Of course,” I said. “I am going to Solovets.” “Do you have relatives there or
familiar?" “No,” I said. I'll just wait guys. They go along the coast, and Solovets is our dot
rendezvous."
Ahead, I saw a large scattering of stones, slowed down and said: "Hold on tight." The car shook and jumped. Hook-nosed bruised his nose on the barrel of a gun. The motor roared, the stones beat in
bottom. "Poor car," said the hawk-nosed one. “What to do…” I said. “Not everyone would go
such a road in your car. “I would go,” I said. The spill is over. "Oh, it's not yours.
car," the hook-nosed man guessed. “Well, how do I get a car! It's a rental." “Understood,” he said.
hook-nosed, as it seemed to me, disappointed. I felt hurt. “What’s the point of buying a car to drive on asphalt? Where there is asphalt, there is nothing interesting, and where it is interesting, there is no asphalt.” “Yes, of course,” the hook-nosed man agreed politely. "It's stupid, in my opinion, to do
from the idol car,” I said. “Stupid,” said the bearded man. But not everyone thinks so. We talked
about cars and came to the conclusion that if you really buy anything, it's the GAZ-69, an all-terrain vehicle, but they,
unfortunately not for sale. Then the hawk-nosed one asked: “Where do you work?” I answered. “Colossal! exclaimed the hunchback. - Programmer! We need a programmer. Listen, leave your institute and come to us!” “What do you have?” “What do we have?” - asked the hook-nosed
turning around. "Aldan-3," said the bearded one. “Rich car,” I said. “And does it work well?”
- "Yes, how can I tell you ..." - "Understood," - I said. “Actually, it has not yet been debugged,” said the bearded one. - Stay with us, debug ... "-" And we will arrange the translation for you in no time, "- added the hook-nosed one. "What are you doing?" I asked. “Like all science,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Human happiness.” “Understood,” I said. “Something with space?” “And with space too,” he said.
hook-nosed. “They don’t look for good from good,” I said. “A capital city and a decent salary,” the bearded man said in a low voice, but I heard him. “No need,” I said. “You don’t have to measure for money.” - "Not really,
I was joking,” said the bearded man. “He's joking like that,” said the hawk-nosed one. - More interesting than ours
you won't be anywhere." - "Why do you think so?" - "Sure". “I'm not sure.” The hawk-nosed chuckled. “We will talk about this again,” he said. “Will you stay in Solovets for a long time?” - "Two days
maximum". “We’ll talk on the second day.” The bearded one said: “Personally, I see in this a finger
fate - walked through the forest and met a programmer. I think you are doomed." - "You really
do you need a programmer? I asked. "We desperately need a programmer." “I'll talk to the guys,” I promised. “I know those who are dissatisfied.” “We don't need just any programmer,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Programmers are a scarce people, they are spoiled, but we need an unspoilt one.” - "Yes it
harder,” I said. The hawk-nosed began to bend his fingers: “We need a programmer: a - not spoiled-

one hundred and twenty rubles. “What about wings? I asked. “Or, shall we say, lights around the head?” One in a thousand!" “We only need one,” said the hawk-nosed one. “And if there are only nine hundred of them?” “Nine-tenths agree.”
The forest parted, we crossed the bridge and rolled between the potato fields. "Nine
hours,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Where are you going to spend the night?” “I'll sleep in the car. Shops near

“The car can be parked near the police,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Yes, this is nonsense,” said the bearded man. - I'm talking nonsense, and you follow me. How will he get into the hostel? “Y-yeah, hell,” said the hawk-nosed one. “Really, if you don’t work for a day, you forget about all these things.” – “Maybe
maybe transgress it? “Well, well,” said the hawk-nosed one. This is not your sofa. And you are not Cristobal Junta, and neither am I ... "
“Don't worry,” I said. I'll sleep in the car, not the first time.
I suddenly felt like sleeping on sheets. I've been sleeping in the bedroom for four nights
bag.
“Listen,” said the hook-nosed one, “ho-ho!” Out of the knife!
- Right! exclaimed the bearded man. - On Lukomorye it!
"By God, I'll sleep in the car," I said.
“You will spend the night in the house,” said the hawk-nosed one, “on relatively clean linen. Should we
thank you somehow...
“It’s not a fifty kopeck for you to poke,” said the bearded one.
We entered the city. Ancient strong fences stretched out, powerful log cabins made of giant blackened logs, with narrow windows, with carved platbands, with wooden cockerels on
roofs. I came across several dirty brick buildings with iron doors, the sight of which brought the semi-familiar word "storage" out of my memory. The street was straight and wide and was called Mira Avenue. Ahead, closer to the center, one could see two-story cinder-block houses with open
public gardens.
“Next alley to the right,” said the hawk-nosed one.
I turned on the turn signal, braked and turned right. The road here is overgrown with grass,
but at some gate stood, crouching, a brand new "Zaporozhets". House numbers hung over the gates, and the numbers were barely visible on the rusty tin of the signs. The lane was elegantly called: “St.
Lukomorye. It was not wide and wedged between heavy old fences, set up, probably
back in the days when Swedish and Norwegian pirates roamed here.
“Stop,” said the hawk-nosed one. I braked and he bumped his nose against the barrel of the gun again. - Now
yes,” he said, rubbing his nose. - You wait for me, and I'll go and arrange everything.
“Really, it’s not worth it,” I said for the last time.
- No talking. Volodya, keep him at gunpoint.
Hook-nosed got out of the car and, bending down, squeezed through the low gate. Behind the tall
the gray fence of the house was not visible. The gates were absolutely phenomenal, as in a locomotive depot, on rusty iron hinges weighing a pound. I read the signs with amazement. There were three. On the left
In the gate, a solid blue signboard with silver letters sternly gleamed with thick glass:
NIICHAVO
Hut on chicken legs
Monument of Solovetsky antiquity
A rusty tin plate hung on top of the right collar: “St. Lukomorye, d. No. 13, N. K.
Gorynych”, and under it was a piece of plywood with an inscription at random in ink:
CAT DOES NOT WORK
Administration
- What CAT? I asked. – Committee of Defense Technology?
The bearded man chuckled.
"You don't have to worry," he said. “It’s funny here, but everything will be all right.I got out of the car and began to wipe the windshield. Above my head they were suddenly imported. I
looked. On the gates he anointed himself, making himself comfortable, a gigantic one - I have never seen such
- black-gray, with divorces, cat. Sitting down, he looked at me with his yellow eyes full and indifferent. “Kiss-kiss-kiss,” I said mechanically. The cat politely and coldly opened its toothy mouth,
hoarse throat sound, and then turned away and began to look inside the courtyard. From there, behind the fence, the voice
hunchbacked said:
- Vasily, my friend, let me disturb you.
The bolt screeched. The cat got up and silently disappeared into the yard. The gates swayed heavily, resounded
a terrifying creak and crack, and the left gate slowly opened. A face red from exertion appeared
hook-nosed.
- Benefactor! he called. - Come on in!
I got back in the car and drove slowly into the yard. The yard was vast, in the depths stood a house made of
thick logs, and in front of the house was a squat, immense oak, wide, dense, with a dense crown that obscured the roof. From the gate to the house, skirting the oak, there was a path lined with stone slabs. To the right of the path was a garden, and to the left, in the middle of the lawn, rose a well
a log house with a gate, black from antiquity and covered with moss.
I parked the car on the side, turned off the engine and got out. Bearded Volodya also got out and,
leaning the gun against the side, he began to adjust the backpack.
“Here you are at home,” he said.
Hook-nosed with a creak and crackling shut the gate, while I, feeling rather awkward, looked around, not knowing what to do.
- And here is the hostess! cried the bearded man. - How are you, grandma, Naina is the light of Kievna!
The owner must have been over a hundred. She walked towards us slowly, leaning on a knotted stick, dragging
feet in felt boots with galoshes. Her face was dark brown; from a continuous mass of wrinkles, a nose protruded forward and downward, crooked and sharp, like a scimitar, and the eyes were pale, dull, as if covered with thorns.
“Hello, hello, granddaughters,” she said in an unexpectedly sonorous bass. - This means,
and there will be a new programmer? Hello father, welcome!
I bowed, knowing that I needed to keep quiet. Grandmother's head over a black downy shawl,
tied under the chin, was covered with a cheerful nylon scarf with multi-colored
images of the Atomium and with inscriptions in different languages: "International Exhibition in Brussels".
A sparse gray stubble protruded from his chin and under his nose. The grandmother was dressed in a wadded sleeveless jacket and
black cloth dress.
- In this way, Naina Kievna! said the hawk-nosed one, coming up and wiping the rust from his palms. - We need to arrange for our new employee for two nights. Let me introduce you... mmm...
“But don’t,” said the old woman, examining me intently. - I see it myself. Privalov Alexander Ivanovich, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eighth, male, Russian, member of the Komsomol, no, no,
did not participate, was not, does not have, but it will be for you, diamond, a long journey and interest in a state-owned house, and
you, diamond, should be afraid of a red-haired, unkind person, but gild the pen, yakhontovy ...
- Hmm! the hawk-nosed one said loudly, and the grandmother broke off. There was an awkward silence.
- You can just call Sasha ... - I squeezed out a pre-prepared phrase.
“And where do I put it?” Grandma asked.
“In the storeroom, of course,” the hawk-nosed man said somewhat irritably.
- And who will answer?
- Naina Kievna! .. - the hawk-nosed roared with the peals of a provincial tragedian, grabbed the old woman
by the hand and dragged to the house. They could be heard arguing: "After all, we agreed! .." - "... And
if he steals something? ..” - “Yes, you be quiet! It's a programmer, right? Komsomolets!
Scientist! .. "-" And if he pokes? .. "
I shyly turned to Volodya. Volodya giggled.
“It’s kind of awkward,” I said.
Don't worry, everything will be fine...
He wanted to say something else, but then the grandmother yelled wildly: “A sofa, a sofa! ..” I shuddered and
said:
“You know, I should probably go, huh?
- Out of the question! Volodya said decisively. - It'll all work out. Grandma just needs
bribe, and Roman and I don't have cash.
“I will pay,” I said. Now I really wanted to leave: I can’t stand these so-called
life conflicts.
Volodya shook his head.
- Nothing like this. He's already on his way. Everything is fine.
Hook-nosed Roman came up to us, took my hand and said:
- Well, everything is fine. Went.
“Listen, it’s uncomfortable somehow,” I said. She doesn't have to, after all...
But we were already on our way home.
“I have to, I have to,” Roman said.
We rounded the oak tree and reached the back porch. Roman pushed open the leatherette-lined door, and we
found themselves in a hallway, spacious and clean, but poorly lit. The old woman was waiting for us with her hands folded
on his stomach and pursed his lips. When she saw us, she boomed vindictively:
- And a receipt to immediately! .. So, they say, and so: they supposedly accepted this and that from such and such, which handed over the above to the undersigned ...
Roman howled softly, and we entered the room allotted to me. It was a cool room with one window, hung with a cotton curtain. Roman said in a tense voice:
- Relax and make yourself at home.
The old woman from the hall immediately inquired jealously:
“But they don’t click their teeth?”
Roman, without turning around, barked:
- Don't chirp! They tell you there are no teeth.
- Then let's go, write a receipt ...
Roman raised his eyebrows, rolled his eyes, bared his teeth and shook his head, but went out anyway. I looked around. There was little furniture in the room. By the window stood a massive table covered with shabby gray
fringed tablecloth, in front of the table - a rickety stool. Near the bare log wall there was a large sofa, on the other wall, covered with wallpaper of various sizes, there was a hanger with some kind of junk (quilted jackets, fur coats that came out, tattered caps and earflaps). A large Russian stove, shining with fresh whitewash, protruded into the room, and opposite in the corner hung a large dim mirror in a shabby
frame. The floor was scraped and covered with striped rugs.
Behind the wall they muttered in two voices: the old woman bassed on one note, Roman's voice rose and fell. “Tablecloth, inventory number two hundred and forty-five ...” - “You still write down every floorboard! ..” - “Dinner table ...” - “Will you also write down the oven? ..” - “Order is needed ... Sofa ...”
I went to the window and drew back the curtain. There was an oak tree outside the window, nothing else was visible. I
began to look at the oak. It was apparently a very ancient plant. The bark on it was gray and somehow
dead, and the monstrous roots that crawled out of the ground were covered with red and white lichen. "AND
write down another oak!” Roman said behind the wall. There was a plump greasy book on the windowsill, I
thoughtlessly leafed through it, moved away from the window and sat down on the sofa. And now I want to sleep. I thought,
that he had been driving for fourteen hours today, that he should not have been in such a hurry, that his back
it hurts me, but everything is confused in my head, that I don’t give a damn about this tedious old woman, and it would soon be over and I could lie down and fall asleep ...
- Well, - said Roman, appearing on the threshold. - The formalities are over. - He waved his hand.
with splayed fingers smeared with ink. - Our fingers are tired: we wrote, we wrote ... Go to bed. We leave, and you calmly go to bed. What are you doing tomorrow?
"I'm waiting," I answered languidly.
- Where?
- Here. And near the post office.
“You won’t leave tomorrow, will you?”
- Tomorrow is unlikely ... Most likely - the day after tomorrow.
"Then we'll see you again." Our love is ahead. He smiled, waved his hand and left. I
lazily thought that it would be necessary to see him off and say goodbye to Volodya, and lay down. Just then an old woman entered the room. I wake up. The old woman looked at me for some time.
“I’m afraid, father, that you’ll start to bark your teeth,” she said with concern.
“I won’t poke,” I said wearily. - I'm going to sleep.
- And lie down and sleep ... Just pay the money and sleep ...
I reached into my back pocket for my wallet.
- How much do I have to pay?
The old woman raised her eyes to the ceiling.
- We'll put a ruble for the room ... Fifty dollars for bed linen - it's mine, not state-owned. Behind
two nights it comes out three rubles...
I know…
I handed her a five.
“So far, a ruble from generosity,” I said. - And it will be seen there.
The old woman quickly grabbed the money and walked away, muttering something about change. She wasn't pretty
for a long time, and I already wanted to give up both change and linen, but she returned and laid a handful of dirty coppers on the table.
“Here’s your change, father,” she said. - Exactly a ruble, you can not count.
“I won’t count,” I said. - What about underwear?
- I'll make a bed now. You go out into the yard, take a walk, and I will make a bed.
I went out, pulling out cigarettes as I went. The sun finally set, and the white night came. Somewhere
dogs barked. I sat down under an oak tree on a bench that had grown into the ground, lit a cigarette and began to look at the pale, starless sky. A cat appeared noiselessly from somewhere, looked at me with fluorescent eyes, then quickly climbed up the oak tree and disappeared into the dark foliage. I immediately forgot about him and shuddered when he was brought somewhere upstairs. Debris fell on my head. "To you ..." - I said aloud and
began to shake off. I was extremely anxious to sleep. An old woman came out of the house, not noticing me, wandered to
well. I understood this to mean that the bed was ready, and returned to the room.
The bad old lady made a bed for me on the floor. Well, no, I thought, locked the door on the latch, dragged the bed onto the sofa and began to undress. A gloomy light fell from the window, a cat bustled noisily on the oak.
I shook my head, shaking the debris out of my hair. It was strange garbage, unexpected: large dry fish scales. It will be a good sleep, I thought, I fell on the pillow and immediately fell asleep.Chapter Two
... The empty house has turned into a den of foxes and badgers, and therefore strange
werewolves and ghosts.
