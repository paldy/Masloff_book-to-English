The forest parted, we crossed the bridge and rolled between the potato fields.  "Nine

“The car can be parked near the police,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Yes, this is nonsense,” said the bearded man.  - I'm talking nonsense, and you follow me.  How will he get into the hostel? “Y-yeah, hell,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Really, if you don’t work for a day, you forget about all these things. ” – “Maybe

“Listen,” said the hook-nosed one, “ho-ho!” Out of the knife!

“It’s not a fifty kopeck for you to poke,” said the bearded one. 
We entered the city.  Ancient strong fences stretched out, powerful log cabins made of giant blackened logs, with narrow windows, with carved platbands, with wooden cockerels on
roofs.  I came across several dirty brick buildings with iron doors, the sight of which brought the semi-familiar word "storage" out of my memory.  The street was straight and wide and was called Mira Avenue.  Ahead, closer to the center, one could see two-story cinder-block houses with open
public gardens. 
“Next alley to the right,” said the hawk-nosed one. 
I turned on the turn signal, braked and turned right.  The road here is overgrown with grass,
but at some gate stood, crouching, a brand new "Zaporozhets".  House numbers hung over the gates, and the numbers were barely visible on the rusty tin of the signs.  The lane was elegantly called: “St. 
Lukomorye.  It was not wide and wedged between heavy old fences, set up, probably
back in the days when Swedish and Norwegian pirates roamed here . ". " The car shook and jumped.  Hook-nosed bruised his nose on the barrel of a gun.  The motor roared, the stones beat in

hook-nosed, as it seemed to me, disappointed.  I felt hurt.  “What’s the point of buying a car to drive on asphalt? Where there is asphalt, there is nothing interesting, and where it is interesting, there is no asphalt. ” “Yes, of course,” the hook-nosed man agreed politely.  "It's stupid, in my opinion, to do
from the idol car,” I said.  “Stupid,” said the bearded man.  But not everyone thinks so.  We talked
about cars and came to the conclusion that if you really buy anything, it's the GAZ-69, an all-terrain vehicle, but they,
unfortunately not for sale. 
“It’s kind of awkward,” I said. 
I threw back the covers and sat up.  - Exactly a ruble, you can not count.  Grandma will tear off her head

A gloomy light fell from the window, a cat bustled noisily on the oak.  “He's joking like that,” said the hawk-nosed one.  I immediately forgot about him and shuddered when he was brought somewhere upstairs. ”

young warriors of science. . .

I sat down under an oak tree on a bench that had grown into the ground, lit a cigarette and began to look at the pale, starless sky.  “This year the summer is dry, everything has dried up.

But in my hand I already had a fork with a bone handle from somewhere, and I began to eat, and the grandmother stood
nearby, nodding and saying:
- Eat, father, eat in good health .  I began to wonder why I had never tasted lobster until now.  I didn't see my reflection. . .  Cursing my fingers, I went to the window and looked out.  Outside the window, someone was clearing his throat.  I carefully put the book down and sat down at the table on a stool.  It was an old rule for recognizing hallucinations, which I read in the fascinating book by V.  The room was still empty. . . 
“Okay…” the cat said through clenched teeth. .  He has a big one on his snout
a piece of meat called a trunk because it is empty and stretched out like a pipe. . . 
“Okay…” the cat said through clenched teeth. 
Bending down like a soldier under fire, I crept up to the window and looked out. 
- "Please, please" . 
- Ate great.  The room was completely light. 
- What's the matter? the voice asked. . . . .  - Magiftherium Antimon Angelii Salae.
