" “I'll talk to the guys,” I promised.  “I know those who are dissatisfied. ” “We don't need just any programmer,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Programmers are a scarce people, they are spoiled, but we need an unspoilt one. ” - "Yes it
harder,” I said.  The hawk-nosed began to bend his fingers: “We need a programmer: a - not spoiled-

one hundred and twenty rubles.  “What about wings? I asked.  “Or, shall we say, lights around the head?” One in a thousand!" “We only need one,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “And if there are only nine hundred of them?” “Nine-tenths agree. ”
The forest parted, we crossed the bridge and rolled between the potato fields.  "Nine
hours,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Where are you going to spend the night?” “I'll sleep in the car.  Shops near
until what time do they work for you?" “Our shops are already closed,” said the hawk-nosed one.  "It is possible in
hostel, - said the bearded man.  “I have an empty bed in my room. ” “You can’t drive up to the hostel,” said the hawk-nosed man thoughtfully.  “Yes, perhaps,” said the bearded man, and for some reason laughed. 
“The car can be parked near the police,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Yes, this is nonsense,” said the bearded man.  - I'm talking nonsense, and you follow me.  How will he get into the hostel? “Y-yeah, hell,” said the hawk-nosed one.  “Really, if you don’t work for a day, you forget about all these things. ” – “Maybe
maybe transgress it? “Well, well,” said the hawk-nosed one.  This is not your sofa.  And you are not Cristobal Junta, and neither am I . . .  "
“Don't worry,” I said.  I'll sleep in the car, not the first time. 
I suddenly felt like sleeping on sheets.  I've been sleeping in the bedroom for four nights
bag. 
“Listen,” said the hook-nosed one, “ho-ho!” Out of the knife!
- Right! exclaimed the bearded man.  - On Lukomorye it!
"By God, I'll sleep in the car," I said. 
“You will spend the night in the house,” said the hawk-nosed one, “on relatively clean linen.  Should we
thank you somehow. . . 
“It’s not a fifty kopeck for you to poke,” said the bearded one. 
We entered the city.  Ancient strong fences stretched out, powerful log cabins made of giant blackened logs, with narrow windows, with carved platbands, with wooden cockerels on
roofs.  I came across several dirty brick buildings with iron doors, the sight of which brought the semi-familiar word "storage" out of my memory.  The street was straight and wide and was called Mira Avenue.  Ahead, closer to the center, one could see two-story cinder-block houses with open
public gardens. 
“Next alley to the right,” said the hawk-nosed one. 
I turned on the turn signal, braked and turned right.  The road here is overgrown with grass,
but at some gate stood, crouching, a brand new "Zaporozhets".  House numbers hung over the gates, and the numbers were barely visible on the rusty tin of the signs.  The lane was elegantly called: “St. 
Lukomorye.  It was not wide and wedged between heavy old fences, set up, probably
back in the days when Swedish and Norwegian pirates roamed here . ". " The car shook and jumped.  Hook-nosed bruised his nose on the barrel of a gun.  The motor roared, the stones beat in
bottom.  "Poor car," said the hawk-nosed one.  “What to do…” I said.  “Not everyone would go
such a road in your car.  “I would go,” I said.  The spill is over.  "Oh, it's not yours. 
car," the hook-nosed man guessed.  “Well, how do I get a car! It's a rental. " “Understood,” he said. 
hook-nosed, as it seemed to me, disappointed.  I felt hurt.  “What’s the point of buying a car to drive on asphalt? Where there is asphalt, there is nothing interesting, and where it is interesting, there is no asphalt. ” “Yes, of course,” the hook-nosed man agreed politely.  "It's stupid, in my opinion, to do
from the idol car,” I said.  “Stupid,” said the bearded man.  But not everyone thinks so.  We talked
about cars and came to the conclusion that if you really buy anything, it's the GAZ-69, an all-terrain vehicle, but they,
unfortunately not for sale. 
“It’s kind of awkward,” I said.
